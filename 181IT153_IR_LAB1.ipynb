       "['The Supreme Court on Monday said there cannot be a \"universal policy\" on right to protest and possible curbs as the situation may vary from case to case.The apex court made the observation while reserving its verdictÂ\\xa0on a batch of pleas against the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests which led to blocking of a road in Shaheen Bagh in the National Capital last December.A bench consisting of justices SK Kaul, Aniruddha Bose, and Krishna Murari stated that the right to protest has to be balanced against other public rights such as the right to mobility.Restrictions had been imposed on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch and the Okhla underpass, which were closed on 15 December due to the protests against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).The protest site was however cleared in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"There were some supervening circumstances which came into play and it was no one\\'s hand. God almighty itself intervened,\" PTI quoted the court as saying.According to Bar&Bench, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said suggested that the petitions may not survive in light of the developments in the case, however, none of the petitioners, barring one agreed to withdraw their pleas.One of the petitioners, Amit Sahni,Â\\xa0said that these kind of protests should not be allowed in larger public interest.\"This was allowed to have continued for more than 100 days and people faced difficulty. This kind of incident should not have happened. Yesterday, there was \\'Chakka Jam\\' in Haryana. They have also called \\'Bharat Bandh\\' onÂ\\xa024 and 25 September,\" he said.Advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for an intervenor, said that there was a right to peaceful protest and \"some people from a political party went there and created riots\".\"We have the right to protest. State machinery is not sacrosanct. Members of a political party went there with the police and created the situation,\" PTI quoted him as saying.Justice Bose said that the right to protest had to be balanced with the right of people to use a public road. \"For a long period of time, a public road was blocked. What about this right to use the road?\", LiveLaw quoted Bose as saying.When Pracha suggested that universal guidelines could be laid down for protests, the bench said:Â\\xa0\"We have to balance right to protest and the blocking of roads. We have to deal with the issue. There cannot be a universal policy as the situation may vary on a case-to-case basis.\"\"In a parliamentary democracy, protest can happen in Parliament and on roads but it has to be peaceful,\" it addedMehta, appearing for the Centre, said that the right to protest cannot be absolute and there are some judgements to this effect.Reserving its verdict, the bench said that it had appointed \"interlocutors\" in the Shaheen Bagh case as an experiment and they had suggested some measures which can be looked into.The top court had earlier heard the pleas, filed by Sahni, former BJP MLA Nand Kishore Garg and Ashutosh Dubey, against the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh.Sahni had earlier approached the high court seeking directions to Delhi Police to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which was blocked by anti-CAA protesters on 15 December. The high court had urged local authorities to deal with the situation, keeping in mind the law and order situation.Sahni has filed a special leave petition in the apex court against the high court\\'s order. The plea sought directions to the police to ensure smooth flow of traffic on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch.It also sought supervision of the situation in Shaheen Bagh, where several women were sitting in protest, by a retired Supreme Court judge or a sitting judge of the Delhi High Court in order to avoid any violence.Separately, Garg, through his counsel Shashank Deo Sudhi, had filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking directions to authorities to remove the protestors from Shaheen Bagh.Garg\\'s plea claimed that various other arterial roads of Delhi have been facing traffic congestion due to the protest at Shaheen Bagh.Alleging that the law enforcement machinery has been \"held hostage to the whims and fancies of the protesters,\" the plea sought laying down of guidelines for protests which led to obstruction of public places.\"It is disappointing that the State machinery is muted and is a silent spectator to hooliganism and vandalism of the protesters, who are threatening the existential efficacy of the democracy and the rule of law and had already taken the law and order situation in their own hand,\" the plea said.The State has a duty to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens, who have been facing trouble due to the road blockade, the plea further said.\"Hence, it is urgently required that public places must not be allowed to be abused and misused for ulterior and mala fide purposes such as staging a protest against a constitutional amendment in the heart of the capital city and thereby causing incalculable hardships and difficulties to the common people,\" it said.According to LiveLaw, the petition filed by Dubey, however, stated that the protests could continue after the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic was over.With inputs from PTI',\n",
       " \"Lakhs of migrant workers who returned to their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh during the lockdown are eagerly waiting for their ration cards in order to avail subsidised food grains allocated under the Public Distribution System in this time of crisis under. An RTI reply has revealed the state has over 18 lakh ration card applications pending with a whopping 91.9 percent of them pending beyond the stipulated 30 days for approval.Uttar Pradesh has witnessed maximum number of migrant workers in the country with more than 31 lakhs having returned from other states during the lockdown, the state's chief secretary had informed on 4 June, 2020.On 12 May, 2020, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had given specific directions that those in need and eligible for subsideised ration should be provided with ration cards, including migrant workers.Between late March when the lockdown was announced in India and the month of May, the state has reportedly issued more than 5.8 lakh ration cards. Yet, 18,84,537 (or 10.2 percent) of the total applications for new ration cards are pending in the state.In all, the state received 1,85,57,659 applications under the State e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway (SSDG) system run by the Food and Civil Supplies Department of Uttar Pradesh. This information has been provided by the department in response to an RTI application filed by this author.While the response from the department does not mention the time period in which these applications were received, the date mentioned for the data compiled by the department is 31 July, 2020.The author has enquired from the department regarding the time period for the applications received and the details are awaited.As per the RTI response, out of the total pending applications, only 1,58,251 or 8.1 percent are pending within the stipulated time period of 30 days for application approval, while 17,31,686 (or a whopping 91.9 percent) are those pending beyond 30 days.Of the total 1.86 crore applications received, the department has accepted 61,29,525 applications (or 33 percent) while 1,05,43,597 (or 56.8 percent) applications have been rejected.Over 30 lakh migrant workers have returned to Uttar Pradesh during Lockdown. APThe information released via RTI also gives a district-wise breakdown of the ration card applications as well. Out of total 75 districts in the state, the highest number of applications have been received in Sitapur district in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. The district also has the highest number of rejections.The least number of applicatios were received in Sonbhadra district in Western Uttar Pradesh. Sonbhadra also ranks lowest in terms of ration card applications approved, rejected as well as pending. Kanpur Nagar in central Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of applications awaiting approval.Among the four regions in Uttar Pradesh â\\x80\\x94 Western, Eastern, Central and Bundelkhand â\\x80\\x94 the highest average number of applications per district have been received in Central Uttar Pradesh while the least have been received in the Bundelkhand region.An analysis of the ration card applications processed by the Food and Civil Supplies Department as stated in the RTI response, revealed a strong positive correlation between the average gross domestic product (GDP) per district (as per the 2017-18 official data from Uttar Pradesh Directorate of Economics and Statistics) and the average number of applications received per district in each of the four regions.Analysis of total applications shows that the more is the average GDP per district of a particular region, the more are the average number of applications received, betraying the logic that people in wealthier regions are less reliant on PDS.However, an analysis of the total existing ration card holders in the four regions paints the opposite picture.There is a fairly strong negative correlation between the region-wise average GDP per district and the average existing ration card holders per district, respectively. What this means is that the more is the average GDP per district of the region, the lesser is the average number of ration card holders per district in each region.Table 1: Region-wise Ration Card StatisticsRegionsNumber of Applications ReceivedAverage Gross Net Product per District (Crores)Average Ration Cards per DistrictBundelkhand118317.48898.393473909.9Central UP368249.222130.62363557.7Eastern UP237428.312363.66504035.3Western UP250992.422034.79485337.2Source: UP Directorate of Economics and Statistics (for economic data); Food and Civil Supplies Department (for ration card data, accessed on 4 September 2020); RTI response (ration card applications)Â\\xa0As of 4 September, the total number of ration cards in the state stood at more than 3.58 crores with more than 3.17 crores priority households, which include both the Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Above Poverty Line (APL) households as per the National Food Security Act 2013 (NFSA). At the same time, there are more than 40.77 Antyodaya ration card holders in the state.

Food and Civil Supplies Department (for ration card data, accessed on 4 September 2020); RTI response (ration card applications)Â\\xa0Surprisingly, Bundelkhand, despite having the lowest average per district GDP, has received the lowest number of average applications for new ration cards per district. It should be noted that the region is widely perceived as underdeveloped and suffering from large scale hunger.In fact, Bundelkhand is the only region with a strong negative correlation between the per capita income of districts and the number of applications, ie, the more is the per capita income the lesser is the number of applications received in the districts of the region.Incidentally, Bundelkhand has had more per capita availability of food grains than the state average as observed between years 1997 and 2006 in the 2009 study on the region by AK Singh, A Joshi and Nomita P Kumar from the Giri Institute of Development Studies.Central Uttar Pradesh which includes important administrative and business districts such as Lucknow and Kanpur, though with the lowest average number of ration card holders per district in the state, has received maximum average number of applications per district.A large backlog of pending applications and the return of more than 30 lakh migrant workers is a worrying combination. Moreover, the pending applications also include those received before the current crisis. The introduction of new ration cards in the state in 2016 replacing the old ones had left many erstwhile ration card holders without one. These ration cards are also a prerequisite for availing benefits for many other schemes such as Ujjwala Gas Yojana (scheme).While the lockdown has spelled disaster for returning migrant workers, those eligible for ration cards who were already living here and have been hit hard by the suspension of economic activity also urgently need them. With slow resumption of economic activity many of the applicants, especially those belonging to the unorganised sector require immediate relief in form of ration allocated under the NFSA.\",\n",

       " 'The Lok Sabha on Monday evening passed a bill amending the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) over the objections of Opposition members who accused the Centre ofÂ\\xa0acting as \\'Big Brother\\'Â\\xa0and alleged that the proposed legislation was brought in to \"target minorities\".The draft law seeks to make it mandatory for officer-bearers of NGOS to provideÂ\\xa0Aadhar numbers at the time of registration and to bar public servants from receiving foreign funds.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The bill also empowersÂ\\xa0the Centre to allow an NGO or association to surrender its FCRA certificate.The Centre, for its part, claimed that the bill is necessary in order to achieve an \\'atmanirbhar Bharat\\'.The bill now needs to beÂ\\xa0passed by the Upper House and then receive a nod from President Ram Nath Kovind.Meanwhile, the Rajya SabhaÂ\\xa0continued to be in an uproar for the second consecutive day following the row over two farm sector bills.Chairman Venkaiah Naidu rejected a notice for no-confidence motion against Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh, stating that itÂ\\xa0was not in the proper format.Eight MPs, including TMC\\'s Derek O\\'Brien and AAP\\'s Sanjay Singh, were suspended for the remainder of the Monsoon Session over their \"unruly behaviour\" on Sunday.Opposition members, objecting to the manner in which the farm bills were passed on Sunday had stormed the Well of the House, torn official papers, climbed on tables, shouted slogans, and threw the rule book at Harivansh after their demand for physical votingÂ\\xa0wentÂ\\xa0unheeded.\\'MHAÂ\\xa0acting as Big Brother\\'During a discussion on theÂ\\xa0Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Bill, 2020,Â\\xa0 Congress MP Anto Antony called the bill \"another exotic adventure\" and warned that it would \"kill NGOs\".Antony claimed that the bill was brought to target minorities.

       " 'The latest quarterly Gross Domestic Product data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation presents a gloomy picture. The Indian economy has contracted by a staggering 23.9 percent in the first quarter of the current financial year â\\x80\\x94 with the labour-intensive construction sector reporting a massive slump of 50.3 percent. For a sector that was already under stress before the pandemic due to the poor financial health of many companies and dwindling output, this news has come as a shocker.But more significantly, the data provide a frightening picture of the impact the pandemic has had on the construction workers- a glimpse of which was also visible from the mass exodus of migrant workers to their villages during the lockdown.A rapid assessment survey conducted by Habitat for Humanityâ\\x80\\x99s Terwilliger Center for Innovation in Shelter interviewed 974 respondents to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 on migrant workers in Maharashtraâ\\x80\\x99s Pune and Ulhasnagar. The report reveals that nearly half the respondents belonged to the construction industry (47 percent), followed by bag manufacturing (23Â\\xa0percent), garment industry (13Â\\xa0percent) and the remaining 17Â\\xa0percent to other sectors. At least, 71Â\\xa0percent of all respondents received no wages after the lockdown and over 63Â\\xa0percent claimed to have no source of livelihood at their places of origin.The survey presents a distressing picture of the plight of migrant workers in the construction sector and other industries - and what the 50Â\\xa0percent fall in construction output means for the many who depend on it.Impact on the construction industry and its workforceThe construction industry in India is the second largest employer after agriculture and has an industry size of Rs 10.5 trillion. According to the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India, prior to the lockdown, there were 20,000 ongoing construction projects in the country and work was being undertaken in as many as 18,000 sites.Together, these projects involved a workforce of over 8.5 million. Moreover, demand from affordable housing segment is expected to decline significantly due to constrained spending capacity of the target group. With more than 6.1 lakh affordable houses under construction buoyed by policy fillip such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and the resultant growth in recent years â\\x80\\x94 muted demand, reduced cash flows, labour shortage and cost escalations could severely hamper revival of the sector. When output from the sector is lost, the jobs and the incomes generated from those jobs are also lost. The loss in incomes was observed even in the Terwilliger Center survey, with only 16 percent of all workers interviewed receiving the same wages as before lockdown, and the remaining 84 percent receiving much less or no income. Further, even from the workers who received the wages, only around 10Â\\xa0percent found it sufficient enough to help them through the lockdown.With no money in hand and no alternative livelihood in the destination states, migrant workers were forced to rely on welfare measures from the government. Data from the Terwilliger Center survey shows that about 28Â\\xa0percent of them received no form of help or support from the government â\\x80\\x94 putting their very lives at risk. It is no surprisem therefore, that almost 26Â\\xa0percent of the workers suffered hunger during the lockdown, with little or no access to food. In fact, for 40Â\\xa0percent workers, access to food and ration was one of their biggest concerns.In such a situation, the existence of active social protection for workers becomes imperative. The construction sector has two laws to provide protection and dignity to its workforce. The first, the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and conditions of service) Act 1996 regulates the employment and conditions of service of building and other construction workers, and provides for their safety, health, and welfare. The second, the BOCW Cess Act, provides for the levy and collection of cess on the cost of construction incurred by employers, with a view to augment the resources of the BOCW Welfare Boards,Â\\xa0used to provide for these workers.The rapid assessment survey highlights the glaring inadequacy of the workersâ\\x80\\x99 registration system under the Act: 96Â\\xa0percent of the workers in the construction sector were not registered under the BOCW Act and thus could not avail its relief package. The survey further reveals that among the 455 respondents employed in the construction sector, 62 percentÂ\\xa0 were not even aware of BOCW, while 20Â\\xa0percent were aware of BOCW, but could not register themselves.To put this in perspective, in June 2020, Ministry of Labour and Employment stated that 20 million workers registered under BOCW were provided cash assistance during the lockdown. As per Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s Periodic Labour Force Survey of employment and unemployment, there were nearly 55 million construction workers in 2017â\\x80\\x9318. This demonstrates that only about 36Â\\xa0percent of the construction workers received the cash entitlements they deserved, making the situation precarious for the large majority of the workers, and often leaving them to fend for themselves.In reality, a large number of workers in the construction industry have been living in precarious conditions even before the pandemic. This is dueÂ\\xa0to the rampant informality present in the construction sector, primarily due to its reliance on migrant labour recruited through a series of sub-contracting processes. About 87.4Â\\xa0percent of workers in the construction sector have been categorised as casual labour, according to the PLFS 2017-18, highlighting the level of informality that prevails in the industry.Informality is also evident through subcontracting â\\x80\\x94 a process deeply embedded within the building construction work. A typical example of a sub-contracting hierarchy involves a realty and infrastructure company handing over specialised tasks to specific subcontracting companies, which in turn delegate hiring responsibilities to petty contractors, who may or may not have an appropriate license. These petty contractors, also known as labour sub-contractors, are responsible for recruiting and onboarding workers. Thus, the structure of recruitment is complex, multi-layered and hierarchical, especially in large construction firms.Petty contractors in such contracting value chain play a crucial role in mobilising large number of labourers needed by the construction industry. The heavy reliance on these contractors was evident from the survey as well; majority of the construction workers (58 percent) surveyed relied on contractors to find jobs, while 26 percentÂ\\xa0found employment on their own and 13Â\\xa0percent through referrals from friends or relatives.Labour economist Ravi Srivastava talks about how this dependence on contractors is more common among short term migrants, in this 2020 paper. \"Short term migrants are much more likely to enter the migrant labour market through contractors from whom they have taken an advance payment and are more likely to be involved in a debt-interlocked migration cycle,\"Â\\xa0he writes.In addition, these short-term migrant workers are largely characterised by an absence of civic identity and citizenship at destination, poorer access to entitlements, labour market discrimination and working and living in substandard conditions. Though significant progress has been made in providing housing for economically weaker sections through the PMAY scheme, short-term migrants, who are multilocal in nature, are left out and often end up living in inadequate shelter in cities as they could neither afford nor access decent housing.They face double marginalisation in the destination states, owing to their identity as outsiders and also due to the informal nature of their occupation. They resort to living in labour colonies and rented accommodation in informal settlements, with no access to basic services. Further, the living conditions of such migrants are congested in nature and conducive for the rapid spread of viruses and diseases. The survey corroborated this - out of all migrant workers surveyed, only 15Â\\xa0percent had access to all necessary conditions required for prevention of COVID-19, such as access to serviceable toilets, clean drinking water, water for washing hands, and enough space to practice physical distancing.All this is emblematic of a larger malaise prevailing in the system- marked by an absence of social protection to the workforce that runs the economy. Seen from this perspective, the 50 percent fall in GVA of the construction sector could exacerbate hunger, loss of livelihood, and lead to distress migration and lack of dignity for workers. Findings from the Terwilliger Center study and several other field assessments since March 2020 indicate the prevalence of all these aspects in the lives of migrant workers.Beyond the official dataThere is a highÂ\\xa0likelihood that the decline of over 50 percent in the activity of the construction sector has been under-reported. This is because a countryâ\\x80\\x99s GDP, as economist Vivek Kaul writes, is based on formal-sector indicators; and the real state of the huge informal sector can be captured only over a period of time, as more and more data come in, not immediately. In India, given that data-collection was affected drastically during the lockdown and that the construction industry is subject to rampant informality and substantial sub-contracting, the impact on the sector, both in terms of loss of output and employment is likely to be worse.For instance, KPMGâ\\x80\\x99s report on the impact of COVID-19 in the construction sector predicted a fall in the Gross Value Added of the construction sector to be 34Â\\xa0percent, (in the worst case scenario of the lockdown extending to 30 June) and the consequent fall in employment to be 25Â\\xa0percent (corresponding to the 34Â\\xa0percent fall in GVA). However, the latest fall in the construction sector GVA of 50.3Â\\xa0percent, based on partial data collection, belies all such expectations. More so, given the nature of construction industry, a fall in output would have a multiplier effect through backward linkages, causing further reduction of the economic activity and job losses. However, all is not lost yet.The rural economy and the role of housingWith a protracted economic recovery looming large, especially in industries such as construction that are dependent on migrant labour, there is an urgent need to revive the rural economy. Transitional remedial measures such as PM Garib Kalyan Yojana and enhanced budget allocation and expansion of works as well as workdays under MGNREGA can help in the short term revival but may not be sufficient given the magnitude of crisis and jobs to be created.Extending the PMAY Gramin programâ\\x80\\x99s tenure and upskilling returnee construction labour on rural masonry skills can create more sustainable jobs besides productively utilizing their skills acquired in cities. This can also lead to improved quality of housing construction under PMAY Gramin.According to a recent GIZ report Improving Housing for Urban Poor - Learnings from BLC Implementation in Odishaâ\\x80\\x9d, it can be seen that 76 percent of PMAY beneficiaries are labourers and 56 percent infact are construction labourers. It is well known that remittances from migrant labour working in cities partly goes towards housing improvements in their hometowns. The current situation presents an opportunity to address the housing gaps among migrant households and enlist those who were left out; and also resolve the issue of incomplete houses caused by migration of beneficiaries to other places for work. Housing has also become the frontline defense against the coronavirus and in this context it is imperative that every migrant worker has access to adequate housing, in both origin and destination states.Willingness to migrate againOne of the important findings of the survey is that, despite the hardships endured in the place of work and in subsequently travelling back to their villages, 59 percent of surveyed migrants expressed willingness to return to their destination state. This willingness was higher among construction workers, where 68Â\\xa0percent expressed willingness to return to the destination state once the government allowed interstate travel. For many of these construction workers (76 percent), the lack of livelihood options in the origin state was a key driver influencing their decision. Not surprisingly, the survey reveals that the migrant workers\\' willingness to return to their place of work was contingent upon the employer providing them with travel arrangements, food and a safe, clean and hygienic workplace and proper accommodation- all basic necessities.Further, because of the nature of the construction sector, petty contractors are the key linchpins in recruiting workers and offering informal intermediation services to employers in mobilising labour. The survey suggests that builders and construction firms should step up in formally recognising their role and paying for their services, while keeping the relationship between the worker and employer linear. Employers can also explore partnerships with civil society organizations to sensitise, train and expand the services of petty contractors as facilitators of entitlements to migrant workers in the destination states.As a significant number of migrant workers are employed in the construction sector, implementation issues in the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Act must be addressed immediately. The welfare boards in destination states need to be inclusive and ease the registration process for migrant workers. One way to do that is by engaging with petty contractors to scale up migrant worker registrations. At the same time, builders and construction firms who contribute cess to the state governments must hold the state BOCW welfare boards accountable and ensure delivery of entitlements for registered workers.Doing away with domicile restrictions to access the Public Distribution System would ensure food security of migrants in the destination states as they return. As regards housing, India does not have a legal framework for the right to housing, which makes it difficult for migrants to acquire shelter and they end up relying on intermediaries or petty contractors for accommodation. Finding sustainable ways to develop and operate the affordable rental housing complexes for migrant workers through market-based models and utilising the Construction Workers Welfare Board funds for housing of migrant construction workers as recommended by the Working Group on Migration in 2017, could go a long way in improving the quality of lives of workers as well as help revive the GDP by rekindling demand.To access the full report, click herePriyansha is with India Migration Now, a South East Migration Foundation Venture based in Mumbai, India.

       " 'Amid rising coronavirus cases in the country,Â\\xa0a survey has revealed that 78 percent of COVID-19 patients who needed an ICU bed had to use â\\x80\\x9cconnections and cloutâ\\x80\\x9dÂ\\xa0 while only four percent were able to secure a bed through the routine process.LocalCircles, a community social media platform that enables people and small businesses to escalate issues for policy and enforcement interventions, said it received many complaints from across the country about not being able to find an ICU bed at government or private hospitals and decided to conduct a survey to assess the situation.It received over 17,000 responses from over 211 districts across India. Of the total respondents, 52 percent were from Tier 1 cities, 26 percent from Tier 2 and 22 percent were from Tier 3, 4 and rural districts. Sixty-five percent of the respondents were men while 35 percent were women.At least 92 percent said it should be mandatory for all hospitals to list real-time ICU bed availability on their websites and entrances, as per the survey.LocalCircles\\' first question to citizens was about the experiences of people in their social network with regards to getting a COVID-19 ICU bed.To ensure that correct feedback is sought, respondents were requested to call upÂ\\xa0their contacts in case they were unaware about the detailed experience of their acquaintances andÂ\\xa0 family members while getting an ICU bed.Fifty-five percent of the respondents, who said that they did not have any person in their network needing a ICU bed, were taken out of the sample and the remaining responses were analysed. It was found that 38 percent respondents had to use clout/connections to secure the ICU bed while seven percent said they had to follow up extensively to secure the ICU bed; 40 percent said they had to use their clout/connections, follow up extensively and they also had to escalate the issue via social media or complain to the government to secure the ICU bed.Seven percent of the respondents said they had to bribe (cash or kind) hospital/government officials to get the ICU bed, while only four percent said they got the ICU bed without any of the above. Another four percent said they did not get an ICU bed at all.This shows that only four percent of those who needed a COVID-19 ICU bed were able to get it through the routine process, while 78 percent had to use connections and clout.In Delhi, for example, patients complained that the Delhi governmentâ\\x80\\x99s app â\\x80\\x98Delhi Coronaâ\\x80\\x99 shows ICU beds available in some hospitals; however, when they call that hospital, they are told that the bed is not available,Â\\xa0LocalCircles founder Sachin Taparia told Indian Express.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said there are around 1,000 ICU beds available in the National Capital. Around 1,500 non-ICU beds and overÂ\\xa0500 ICU bedsÂ\\xa0were added over the last few days, he said.\"The number of vacant beds is available on Delhi Corona app... nothing is being concealed,\" news agency PTI quoted him as saying.The health minister also attributed the high occupancy of ICU beds in private hospitals to people coming from outside.\"People coming in from outside prefer private hospitals. They make up their mind in advance and directly go to these four-five hospitals they have heard of... such as Max, Apollo and Fortis. That\\'s why ICU beds are full there,\" he said.\"Most of them have occupied ICU beds in private hospitals. There are 1,500 such patients admitted to Delhi hospitals,\" he further stated.In the next question on LocalCircles\\' survey, people were asked, whether it should be made mandatory for hospitals to list real-time ICU bed availability on their websites and at entrances, given the shortage of ICU beds.A whopping 92 percent responded in favour of the measure while seven percentÂ\\xa0voted against it. The remaining one percent chose the \"can\\'t say\" option.\"According to a lot of citizens, those with clout and connections are able to get an ICU bed even if they have mild symptoms while many common citizensÂ\\xa0including healthcare workers with severe symptoms are being denied an ICU bed or being granted the same much later.

       " 'The Supreme Court,Â\\xa0hearingÂ\\xa0the Sudarshan TV case in which it has imposed a pre-telecast ban on the channel\\'sÂ\\xa0\\'UPSC Jihad\\' programmes, on Monday said it is extremely concerned with balancing the right to dignity of a community with that of free speech, according to several media reports.As per Live Law, Justice DY Chandrachud, heading the apex court bench also comprising justices Indu Malhotra and KM Joseph,Â\\xa0said, \"If it was a balance between free speech and dignity of an individual, we can tell him to file a civil suit. But here the balance is to be drawn between free speech and a community.\"JusticeÂ\\xa0Chandrachud, pondering the nature and extent of the apex court\\'s injunction, further remarked as per Live Law: â\\x80\\x9cThe issue is... what should be the nature of an injunction? Whether it should be a blanket injunction and if the court does issue it would it also injunct protected speech or should the court restrict him only to a certain extent?\"As per PTI, in a two-hour hearing, the bench said constitutional values and human dignity need to be protected but the court cannot â\\x80\\x9cbecome the enforcers of programme codeâ\\x80\\x9d.Sudarshan TV, at the outset,Â\\xa0urged the apex court to lift the stay on the telecast of the remaining six episodes of the controversial programme, saying the channel would abide by laws. â\\x80\\x9cDo you think that you followed programme code and whether you will telecast the remaining shows in the same tone and tenor?â\\x80\\x9d the bench asked as per PTI.â\\x80\\x9cYes, we have followed the programme code and compiled the law and the remaining episodes will also be on the same line. Please see the four episodes through my client\\'s eyes,â\\x80\\x9d lawyer Vishnu Shankar Jain, appearing for Sudarshan TV Editor-in-Chief Suresh Chavhanke, replied, as per PTI.As perÂ\\xa0PTI,Â\\xa0lawyer Shadan Farasat, representing Jamia students in the Supreme Court, said,Â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cNow Sudarshan TV says it will continue to telecast the programme in the same tenor. Participation of Muslims in civil service and in Parliament is a threat and they are about to take over the country. This is the theme. Each and every episode is a violation of programme code.â\\x80\\x9dAfter which Justice Chandrachud, as perÂ\\xa0Bar and Bench, stated,Â\\xa0Â\\xa0\"There is indeed some public interest for editor of Sudarshan TV to say that certain foreign funding is happening for ZFI and it may be an extreme issue, but he has right to his opinion. If we issue an injunction then should it be a blanket injunction which covers protected speech or should the court issue an injunction which allows broadcast [without allowing the channel to] stereotype a community or indulge in conspiracy theory or paint one entire community with the same brush?\"Farasat responded, \"Normally my preference would be limited injunction in interest of free speech. But here will limited injunction be useful?\"\"It is not a trademark suit that we will say don\\'t use a man with a beard or cap. Here, what should the court do as part of the injunctive order? We can\\'t order in specifics as it will denigrate the standard of a constitutional court,\"Â\\xa0Justice Chandrachud then said, as perÂ\\xa0Bar and Bench.As per PTI, the apex court bench also expressedÂ\\xa0its displeasure that the news channel, in an affidavit, pointed to anÂ\\xa0English news channel that ran two shows on Hindu terror. \"Who asked about your opinion about the programmes?â\\x80\\x9d the bench queried.Jain responded that his affidavit contained a referenceÂ\\xa0to the English channel and their programmes on Hindu terror as he was asked earlier as to why the \\'\\'UPSC Jihad\\'\\' episodes have â\\x80\\x9cshown Muslim men in skull caps and wearing greensâ\\x80\\x9d.The bench, chastising the lawyer, said: â\\x80\\x9cDoes this mean that every time that judges ask questions you will shoot your mouth off? If that is the case, then judges will stop asking questions. You are not supposed to file affidavits on all the questions which judges asks.

The electronic media would normally have a geographical barrier and would rarely have a global presence. The digital media, on the other hand, has global presence both in terms of content coming from out of India and the content going out from within the country,â\\x80\\x9d it said.â\\x80\\x9cAs against this, there is absolutely no check on the web based digital media. Apart from spreading venomous hatred, deliberate and intended instigation to not only cause violence but even terrorism it is also capable of indulging in tarnishing the image of individuals and institutions. The said practice is, in fact, rampant,â\\x80\\x9d the affidavit stated.The Centre hadÂ\\xa0on 17 September filed a short affidavit in the matter and said that if the Supreme Court decides on the issue of media regulation then such an exercise should be undertaken with the digital media first as it has faster reach and information has the potential to go viral due to applications like WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook.',\n",

The state governments were given the authority to review the situation and take a decision on reopening schools as part of the Centre\\'s \\'Unlock 4\\' guidelines.The states that decided to reopen schools on Monday, said the attendance of students was \"voluntary\" and also sought written consent from parents sending their children to school.In Jammu and Kashmir, only a few students turned up to attend special classes on Monday as schools for higher classes reopened in the Union Territory.Principal secretary, School Education and Skill Development, Asgar Hassan Samoon said the reopening of schools was not meant for regular classes.\"I was on a visit to Reasi district and only five to seven students were present in different schools and attending the special meetings with their teachers meant to clear their doubts,\" director, school education, Jammu, Anuradha Gupta told PTI.She said the school management has been directed to devise a mechanism to ensure the students make the best of the opportunity and come out with a roster to fulfil the requirement of the students.The decision of the government to reopen the schools came under sharp criticism from Opposition parties, including the National Conference and the Congress, who questioned the rationale behind the opening of school from classes 9 to 12 amid the pandemic.\"We have not opened the schools for regular classes. The partial reopening is to facilitate the students to clear their doubts in any subject in their classrooms while following all the precautionary measures to avoid COVID-19,\" GuptaÂ\\xa0said.The school education department has worked out arrangements with the school management, which undertook fumigation and sanitisation and made available an adequate number of hand sanitisers and face masks to students.Meanwhile, the PunjabÂ\\xa0government has allowed students of classes 9 to 12 to visit their schools in areas outside containment zones on voluntary basis.However, this permission will be subject to written consent of parents/guardians from 21 September as per Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on 8 September, the state government said in a statement.The state home department has issued detailed instructions to also permit skill or entrepreneurship training in National Skill Training Institutes, Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), short term training centres registered with the National Skill Development Corporation or State Skill Development Missions or other ministries of the Government of India or the state governments, the release said.Likewise, activities of National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (NIESBUD), Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE) and their training providers have also been allowed from 21 September subject to strict adherence of the said SOPs, it added.On the other hand, states like Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Uttarakhand, West Bengal announced schools will not reopen this week.\\'30% of COVID patients from other states\\'Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday that said 30 percent of the COVID-19 patients admitted in city hospitals are from other states, and added that most of them have been occupying ICU beds at private facilities.Amid a rise in the number of non-resident patients, the Delhi government has decided to collect data of their deaths separately, he said, adding that the National Capital has the \"lowest death rate\" in the country.Based on data of the last 10 days, the death rate in Delhi stands at 0.77 percent. \"Around 30 percent COVID-19 patients admitted to Delhi hospitals are from outside the city,\" he told reporters.\"People coming in from outside prefer private hospitals.

I have a hunch that the state government knowingly provides them shelter to reap political benefits.â\\x80\\x9dGhosh alleged that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was not cooperating with the Centre in getting land for erecting fences along the porous borders with Bangladesh because terror operatives who sneak in from the neighbouring country work towards her political purpose.â\\x80\\x9cThe TMC and the terrorists have a give and take policy. The TMC helps infiltrators get false nationality documents and now, the party is colluding with the Maoists and Islamic terrorists to eliminate their political opponents,â\\x80\\x9d Ghosh later said.Notably, the three others who were arrested from Ernakulam district in Kerala in a simultaneous raid by the NIA also hail from Murshidabad.Over the past five years, Central and state agencies have arrested alleged operatives of the IS, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh, or JMB, from the state. Bengal shares 2,217 kilometres of border with Bangladesh. Nearly half it remains unfenced to date.In a press statement issued on Saturday, the NIA said that â\\x80\\x98large quantity of incriminating materials including digital devices, documents, jihadi literature, sharp weapons, country-made firearms, a locally fabricated body armour, articles and literature used for making home-made explosive devicesâ\\x80\\x99 had been seized from the possession of the arrested persons.They were â\\x80\\x98radicalised by Pakistan-based Al-Qaeda terrorists on social mediaâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98were motivated to undertake attacks at multiple places including the National Capital Regionâ\\x80\\x99, the NIA said, adding that they were â\\x80\\x98actively indulging in fundraisingâ\\x80\\x99 and that some of them had a plan to visit New Delhi procure arms and ammunition.On Sunday, the BJPâ\\x80\\x99s state unit general secretary Sayantan Basu upped the ante on the state government, saying the party had been rightly pointing out since 2014 that there was a plan to turn West Bengal into West Bangladesh.â\\x80\\x9cWe warned that the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s patronage of unregulated madrasahs was creating (Osama bin) Laden-factories. The latest arrests were of persons born and brought up here. We no longer have only terrorists who infiltrated from Bangladesh and got their (nationality) documents here but now we also have our homegrown ones, thanks to the chief ministerâ\\x80\\x99s policy of going to any extent to appease a community of 30 percent,â\\x80\\x9d Basu said.Bengal BJP leaders use â\\x80\\x98thirty percentâ\\x80\\x99 usually to refer to Muslims, who made 27 percent of the stateâ\\x80\\x99s population, according to the Census of 2011.The TMC tried to divert the salvos at the Centre. â\\x80\\x9cThe border is protected by the Border Security Force (BSF), which operates under the Union government. What were the BSF and other Central agencies doing when dangerous terrorists crossed over the borders?â\\x80\\x9d TMC Lok Sabha MPs Sougata Roy asked. Kalyan Banerjee, also a Lok Sabha MP, echoed him.However, political analysts and independent observers said the arrests were going to add to the BJPâ\\x80\\x99s ammo for their political campaign in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly elections, as the spread of Islamic terror networks in the state has been one of the BJPâ\\x80\\x99s key issues against the state government over the past six years.The reaction of Sujan Chakraborty, the leader of the Left parties in the state Assembly, indicated that he apprehended the BJP would gain mileage from these arrests. â\\x80\\x9cWhat was the state administration doing? Were they sleeping? Why are they giving opportunities to the Centre?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.â\\x80\\x98Far-reaching impactâ\\x80\\x99Psephologist Biswanath Chakraborty, a professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University in Kolkata, said that the Murshidabad arrests were going to have â\\x80\\x98a far-reachingâ\\x80\\x99 impact on the stateâ\\x80\\x99s politics ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections.â\\x80\\x9cTerror links to the state have helped the BJP since 2014 in building its campaign branding the Mamata Banerjee government as a patron of Islamic radicalism. Now, itâ\\x80\\x99s time for their campaign to intensify,â\\x80\\x9d the psephologist said.Bengalâ\\x80\\x99s link to cross-border terror organisations first came to the limelight in October 2014, when an accidental blast at Khagragarh in Burdwan district opened the lid of a flourishing network of JMB across the districts of Murshidabad, Birbhum, Burdwan, and Nadia -- all having a significant Muslim population.The JMB was banned in Bangladesh in 2005 and the investigation in the 2014 blast revealed some of Bangladeshâ\\x80\\x99 most-wanted terrorists were building the organisationâ\\x80\\x99s India networks staying in West Bengal over the past few years.Soon after the revelation of JMB links to the Khagragarh blast, the BJP and other organisations affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) â\\x80\\x94 such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Hindu Jagran Manch â\\x80\\x94 launched a sustained campaign seeking â\\x80\\x98jihadi-mukto Banglaâ\\x80\\x99, or a Bengal free from Islamic terror operatives.Since then the NIA, and the state police as well, made a series of arrests of operatives linked to the JMBâ\\x80\\x99s pro-Al Qaeda faction and the pro-IS faction, from different Bengal districts. Some of them were associated with small, unregulated madrasahs is nondescript localities. Some of the blast accused were later arrested by authorities in Bangladesh after they crossed over to that country. Overall, more than two dozen JMB operatives, including Indian and Bangladeshi nationals, have been arrested from the state.In 2017, the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), or the highest decision-making body of the RSS, adopted a resolution expressing â\\x80\\x98grave concern over the unabated rise in violence by Jehadi elements in West Bengal, encouragement to the anti-national elements by the state government due to its Muslim vote bank politicsâ\\x80\\x99. The resolution called upon â\\x80\\x98the countrymen to create awareness against this Jihadi violence and communal politics of the state governmentâ\\x80\\x99.During the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 when the state witnessed widespread protests against the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), Bengal BJP leaders repeatedly cited terror operativesâ\\x80\\x99 links with the state to justify their demand for a citizenship screening exercise to weed out infiltrators.After Saturdayâ\\x80\\x99s arrests, Ajay Kumar Nandi, the eastern regional sanghachalak (president) of the RSS, said that the state government must take the responsibility for the mushrooming of terror networks.â\\x80\\x9cThere should be a ceaseless flow of information between the state government and the Centre on terrorist activities. But there is no claim even on part of the state government that they supplied the Centre with any information. This is a question of national security and politics should have no part in influencing a governmentâ\\x80\\x99s role. The state government will have to answer before the people,â\\x80\\x9d Nandi said.Political observers said they could foresee the political ramifications of the arrests. According to Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, a former principal of Presidency College in Kolkata, the BJP will sharpen its campaign against the state government and the stateâ\\x80\\x99s ruling party will find itself in a defensive position.â\\x80\\x9cThe BJP has been saying for the past five-six years that Bengal has turned into a hub of terrorist activities due to Mamata Banerjeeâ\\x80\\x99s policies that encouraged infiltration. They also accused her of giving patronage to radical Islamists. Now, they will claim to be standing vindicated,â\\x80\\x9d Mukhopadhyay said.Biswanath Chakraborty said that the BJP will also look the exploit the issue projecting the rationality of the CAA and NRC.â\\x80\\x9cThe TMC will remain quiet and take a soft stance, without committing itself to any position. They certainly do not want to be seen as acting against the national interest. However, the TMC is more than likely to launch a whispering campaign and make attempts to find a converging point with the voices that allege socio-economically backward Muslims are being unjustly targeted by the Centre,â\\x80\\x9d Chakraborty said.Recent rapid activities The NIA stepped up its activities involving possible terror links to West Bengal in 2020. They have registered as many as six cases of suspected terrorist activities involving the state in this year, compared to only one each in 2016, 2015, and 2014. Most of the arrests of alleged JMB operatives that took place during 2014 and 2019 were connected to the accidental blast in Burdwan in 2014.In April 2020, the NIA took over the investigation into the case of a 21-year-old women college studentâ\\x80\\x99s alleged links with Lashkar-e-Taiba. Tania Parvin, a resident of Baduria in North 24-Parganas district, an area bordering Bangladesh, was first arrested by the state police in March.The second case that the NIA took over in April was regarding the discovery of a major illegal firecracker factory at Naihati area in North 24-Parganas district. A fire at the factory led to a blast, causing five deaths on the spot and leaving two others badly injured.In May, the NIA took over a case of January 2020 in which the home of a Malda resident was found to be a storehouse of explosives. This storage, too, had come to the light after an explosion took place at the residence.Early in September, the NIA took over the investigation into two cases from the state police. One of them was a one-year-old case of an explosion at the home of a resident of Birbhum district. The state police had started an investigation in September 2019. The other case, too, was of storage of explosives and crude bombs at the home of a Birbhum district resident. The state police had started an investigation in the previous month.Besides, the special task force of Gujarat policed picked up a man from North 24-Parganas district in August for having LeT links.The NIA also reopened an 11-year-old case against Chhatradhar Mahato, who served as a spokesperson of a Maoist-backed tribal outfit during 2008-09. He was released earlier this year after serving 10 years in jail and joined the TMC soon after. TMC leaders had alleged that the NIA was being used by the Centre to harass and intimidate Mahato. After facing the NIAâ\\x80\\x99s grilling several times in August, Mahato has now been asked to appear before an NIA court.Ranjit Sur, vice-president of Association for Protection of Human Rights (APDR), the stateâ\\x80\\x99s largest human rights organisation, said he suspects the NIA could be acting in the political interests of the BJP. He was expecting arrests of more persons from West Bengal with alleged terror links in the coming days, he said.â\\x80\\x9cWe do not yet know much about the persons arrested from Murshidabad and Ernakulam. However, the role of NIA into the investigation of Maharashtraâ\\x80\\x99s Elgar Parishad case and the recent reopening of a case against Chhatradhar Mahato prompts us to strongly suspect political interest behind NIAâ\\x80\\x99s moves. It has come to our knowledge that the persons arrested from Murshidabad were associated with the movement against CAA. There are reasons to suspect that the arrests could be an attempt to weaken the anti-CAA movement,â\\x80\\x9d Sur said.Incidentally, Ghosh, too, spoke of the anti-CAA movement with reference to the Murshidabad arrests.â\\x80\\x9cMurshidabad turns out to be a hub of terrorists. From JMB to Al Qaeda, every terror group has a presence here. And it was Murshidabad where the anti-CAA movement took the most violent shape in the state. It appears that I had rightly pointed out at that time (December 2019) that the anti-CAA protesters indulging in violence had terror links,â\\x80\\x9d Ghosh said on Sunday.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a TMC Rajya Sabha MP said that the party would take time before coming to any conclusion on whether there has been any political motive behind these arrests.â\\x80\\x9cOur government is very serious about terror networks and the state police have made a series of arrests. However, we are aware that the BJP has a plan to frame rules for the CAA in the coming few months and re-launch its campaign in support of the CAA ahead of the Assembly elections. At present, we prefer to watch their next steps,â\\x80\\x9d the Rajya Sabha MP said.The CAA, which offers citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s neighbouring Islamic countries, is one of the BJPâ\\x80\\x99s key weapons to win over the Bangladeshi Hindu refugees settled in West Bengal. The TMC has been strongly opposing both CAA and NRC, accusing the former of being discriminatory towards Muslims.The author is a Kolkata-based journalist and author of â\\x80\\x98Mission Bengal: A Saffron Experimentâ\\x80\\x99',\n",

       " 'A total of 1,256 cases of illegal trading of wildlife and poaching of endangered animals were recorded between 2017 and 2019, and 2,313 offenders arrested, the environment ministry informed Parliament on Saturday.In a written reply to a query by CPI MP Binoy Viswam, Union Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Babul Supriyo said 313 alerts and advisories were issued by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) between 2017 and 2020 for preventive action against poaching and illegal trade of wildlife.The animals were victims of poaching and illegal trafficking and 478 animals were killed in 2017, 492 in 2018 and 286 in 2019. Credit: PexelsHe said the management of forests and wildlife is primarily the responsibility of states and union territories.Financial assistance is provided to them under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats for providing better protection to wildlife including endangered species, improvement of their habitat and to ensure harmonious existence of human settlements with wild animals, he said.Referring to data available with the WCCB and provided by states and UTs, the minister said 478 endangered animals were killed in 2017, 492 in 2018 and 286 in 2019. The animals were victims of poaching and illegal trafficking.\"The total number of accused arrested for wildlife poaching and illegal trafficking of wild animals during the last three years are -- 880 in 2017, 858 in 2018 and 575 in 2019,\" he said.Supriyo also informed the House that 3,275 forest and police officials were trained under 70 capacity building programs in these three years, while 16,728 officials of border guarding forces, customs, Central Industrial Security Force, judicial officers and other stakeholders were sensitised by the WCCB.\"The local communities are involved in conservation measures through eco-development activities who help the forest department in protection of wildlife.

       " 'The possibility of the minimum support price system being dismantled and corporatisation of agriculture are the main concerns of farmers protesting the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s proposed legal changes, agriculture expert Ajay Vir Jakhar told Firstpost.Jakhar, who is himself a farmer based in Punjabâ\\x80\\x99s Fazilka district, is the chairman of farmersâ\\x80\\x99 association Bharat Krishak Samaj.He expressed his concerns through the interview on a day that the Rajya Sabha passed two of the three crucial agriculture-related bills amidst a chorus of protests both inside the House and outside it.The two Bills that have now been passed by the Parliament are the Farmerâ\\x80\\x99s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. While the first bill allows farmers to sell their produce outside the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), the second one provides a framework allowing farmers to enter into contract farming.Farmers protesting the bills on Sunday blocked multiple highways in Haryana, and agitations on the issue have also been planned in several other places in the upcoming days. The government, on other hand, claims that the proposed laws will help cultivators get better prices for their produce and end the role of middlemen.Responding to these claims, Jakhar said that the bills will result in a trickle-down model, which will only create large monopolies and not help farmers.Edited excerpts follow:According to you, what are the biggest fears of the protesting farmers right now?There is a historical background which needs to be kept in mind to understand why farmers are presently fearful. First of all, there was a report of the Shanta Kumar Committee, which opposed several aspects of the Public Distribution System (PDS), the Food Corporation of India, Minimum Support Prices, etc. (The report, submitted in January 2015, was on â\\x80\\x98reorienting the role and restructuring of Food Corporation of Indiaâ\\x80\\x99). Shanta Kumar is a BJP leader and is the former chief minister of Himachal Pradesh.Further, the tendency of the present government is to favour cash transfers rather than giving goods and services â\\x80\\x94 whether for the PM-KISAN scheme or gas cylinder subsidies or the suchlike. Last year, the CACP (Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices) had also raised concerns in a report about open-ended procurement. (The system of open-ended procurement is one in which government agencies buy whatever quantity of foodgrains is offered by farmers at the MSP, subject to some conditions of time and quality). Even this year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said in a report that open-ended procurement and minimum support prices create problems. Lastly, (Union minister) Nitin Gadkari is also reported to have said that minimum support prices are higher than domestic market prices and international markets, and that we need to look for â\\x80\\x98alternatives.â\\x80\\x99 All of these things point towards the possibility that the minimum support price regime could be dismantled.But the government has specifically assured that the minimum support price regime will remain. How do you view this assurance?It is true that the government, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has said that the minimum support price (MSP) will remain. However, farmers find this statement to be deceptive. Even at present, there are MSPs for about 25 crops, but government agencies do not actually procure most of them. A possibility is that in the future as well, MSPs will be announced but they will not give any actual benefit to farmers.. Further, there is a fear that in the future, if the PDS system is rolled back, the government will not need to procure anything. There is also the question of whether the Food Corporation of India has the infrastructure to store the grain that is procured by government agencies.Let us take the examples of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where the state governments do not engage in open-ended procurement. Generally, only five acresâ\\x80\\x99 worth of produce is procured. Cultivators in Punjab and Haryana fear that this will happen to them.Recently, you had said that Punjab has a successful agricultural mandi model, which should be replicated elsewhere as well. Could you elaborate on why it is so?Amidst the COVID-19 lockdown, there were about 3,000 procurement centres in Punjab. This network was the reason why procurement at the minimum support could happen to an extent in the state.Some experts such as Ashok Gulati have argued that the proposed laws will benefit the farmers by ensuring more competition and better prices. How would you respond to these views?I fail to see how that will turn out to be true. The government seems to be saying that it will give loans to industries and industries will invest in procuring farm produce. This is a trickle-down model, which will not work for farmers. There are other concerns as well. For example, the government has recently banned the export of onions, which has effectively put a cap on the prices of the commodity. This is hardly an enabling environment for traders to invest in agricultural procurement. And even if traders invest, there is no certainty that farmers will benefit. What is more likely to happen is that there will be large monopolies, and small traders will get wiped out.The government has also claimed that the bills will end the role of middlemen, which is also a far-fetched claim. My position has always been that middlemen can never be â\\x80\\x98finished offâ\\x80\\x99 and anyone who makes such a claim is living in a daydream.Do you believe that concerns about the bills are largely restricted to Punjab and Haryana, or do you think that farmers in other states also have reasons to worry?There are two broad areas of concerns. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana are particularly concerned about MSPs, but they gain more from the system as compared to other parts of India. At the same time, in other parts of the country as well, farmers fear corporatisation of agriculture and larger monopolies. They are concerned that they may get an even worse deal than earlier.What would be the best way for the government to reassure the agitating farmers?The government should clearly state that open-ended procurement of paddy and wheat in Punjab and Haryana will not stop. However, unfortunately, it is not making such a statement as of now, and the reason for not making such a statement could be that it does intend to stop this system. The government must clarify on this if it wants to assuage the concerns of the farmers.',\n",

They asked the officials to focus on the data analysis and stepping up the testing, contact tracing and surveillance of the areas from where more cases are detected so that chain can be broken,\" the spokesman said.He said the team suggested the measures to be implemented in the containment zones and asked them to involve ASHA and field Health staff to identify ILI cases so that testing of all can be done.\"Door-to-door survey was suggested for identifying high-risk persons like pregnant women or the elderly and those with comorbidity,\" he said.With inputs from PTI',\n",
       " 'New Delhi: Political confrontation between the ruling NDA and Opposition parties is likely to escalate over the Sunday ruckus in Rajya Sabha, as the BJP is planning to move a motion seeking strong action against those accused of unruly behaviour in the House during the passage of two farm bills.The development comes after 12 Opposition parties gave a notice for a no-confidence motion against Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh over the manner in which the bills were passed in the House after he overruled their pleas for an adjournment of the proceedings.Soon after Opposition parties gave the notice, several Union ministers visited Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and discussed with him the entire episode of unruly behaviour and ruckus allegedly created by Opposition MPs, a source said.The government is planning to move a motion on Monday morning in Rajya Sabha seeking action against Opposition members for creating ruckus and insulting the chair, the source said.The way Opposition members stood on officials\\' table and damaged mic in front of the Chair \"deserves stringent action\", the source added.The Rajya Sabha on Sunday witnessed unruly scenes with members throwing papers at Harivansh, who was presiding the House during the passage of the Farmers\\' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill.Opposition members were seen standing on officials\\' tables and even broke the mic in front of the Chair as they alleged that their demand for a division of votes on their motion to refer the legislation to a select committee was overruled.The bills were passed through voice votes amid the din caused by Opposition protests.The parties that have submitted the notice against the Deputy Chairman include the Congress, All India Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, Telangana Rashtra Samithi, CPI, CPM, Nationalist Congress Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, National Conference, DMK and the Aam Aadmi Party.',\n",
       " 'Chandigarh: Farmers on Sunday blocked roads in Haryana and burnt effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in neighbouring Punjab, in protest against the farm bills passed in Parliament.Two MLAs from the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), which is part of the BJP-led ruling coalition in Haryana, also participated in the protests, reflecting a rift on the issue among their ranks.Farmers occupied portions of roads and highways at several places in the state between 12 and 3 pm, following a call given by the Haryana unit of the Bhartiya Kisan Union against the agri-marketing bills, two of which were passed by Rajya Sabha on Sunday.After 3 pm, reports said the road blockades were lifted, ending the day\\'s protests in which BKU was also supported by several other farmer organisations.In Ambala, Haryana Police used a water cannon at the state\\'s border to stop Punjab Youth Congress workers from entering the district and travelling ahead to Delhi as part of their tractor rally.The Punjab protesters set fire to one of their own tractors when they were forced to end their rally at the Haryana border, police said.Farmers were joined by \\'arhitiyas\\' â\\x80\\x94 or the commission agents at mandi\\' â\\x80\\x94 during their protests at many places in Haryana.There was heavy police deployment across the state, particularly where the bigger gatherings were expected.Police diverted traffic to alternative routes. Executive magistrates were stationed along with police at many protest venues.Ambala-Nahan national highway near Naraingarh, Jind-Patiala and Jind-Delhi roads near Julana and Sonipat-Gohana highway were among the roads blocked in Haryana.Traffic was also disrupted on Ambala-Chandigarh highway due to the protests by the Punjab Youth Congress activists. But there was no blockade on the Ambala-Delhi road.The situation at the Haryana-Punjab border was tense for a while as Youth Congress activists were bent upon moving on the national highway towards Delhi.But the spot was heavily barricaded by police, who also used water cannons to disperse the protesters.Farmers at several places in Punjab burnt effigies and copies of the farm bills, claiming that the new laws will destroy their livelihood.The three bills are aimed at giving farmers the choice to sell their produce at competitive prices. But many farm organisations fear they will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system.Two JJP MLAs, Jogi Ram Sihag (Barwala) and Ram Karan Kala (Shahbad), participated in the Haryana protests, going against the official line spelled out by the party\\'s senior leader and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala.Sihag said he will not hesitate even to resign if his constituents want him to do that when at any point they feel that the farmers\\' interests are compromised.Chautala, however, hit out at the Opposition Congress accusing it of misleading farmers.Nowhere in the new farm reforms there is any talk of abolishing the crop MSP, he told reporters.Varun Chaudhary, the Haryana Congress MLA from Mullana in Ambala who joined the protest at Mandour village near Panjokhra Sahib, said the bills were not a shield for farmers but for hoarders.Meham Independent MLA, Balraj Kundu, who protested in Rohtak and Charkhi Dadri districts, claimed the bills will benefit the corporates.From 2 October, I will sit on a fast to protest against these anti-farmer measures, he said.In Yamunanagar, Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh said, It is the country\\'s misfortune that despite the farmers\\' protest these bills were passed.He called it a murder of democracy.\"Laws are for people and if they are the ones who are protesting then for whose benefit have they been passed?\" he said. These laws are not pro-farmers as the government claims, but the big corporates will benefit.He said the statewide protest was peaceful and 17 farmers\\' organisations extended their support.Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar, who also joined the Youth Congress protesters, said all parties except the Akali Dal and the BJP are with the farmers.He slammed Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, accusing him of earlier supporting these \"black laws\". The SAD has pulled out of the Union government in protest against the bills.Joining the tractor rally, Indian Youth Congress president Srinivas BV said his party stands shoulder to shoulder with the farmers.This government wants to destroy 80 crore families. Former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the \\'Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan\\' slogan, but under the present regime the farmers are ruined, Srinivas said.Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja said when a Congress-led government comes to power the law will be repealed. The party will hold protests on Monday against the anti-farmer bills at district headquarters across Haryana.On Sunday, Rajya Sabha passed the Farmers\\' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020.The bills were passed by Lok Sabha on Thursday.

They should\\'ve at least condemned the practice by Deputy Chairman.\"But they are justifying the Deputy Chairman, and the procedure.

The Maharashtra party has three members in Rajya Sabha.Several other regional parties, including three-member Aam Aadmi Party, Samajwadi Party with eight seats, and BSP with four, have joined the opposition\\'s ranks in protest against these bills but it may not prove enough to hinder their passage.Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'\\'s forceful defence of the three bills and blistering criticism of the Opposition for protesting against them on Thursday made it clear that he remains unfazed by the opposition and that his government will press on to get Parliament\\'\\'s nod for these measures aimed at opening private avenues for farmers to sell their produce.His assertion came amid Congress and several other parties besides the SAD coming out strongly against these bills, calling them \"anti-farmers\".Farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against these proposed laws which, their leaders allege, will end up dismantling the existing government-backed support system they have.A number count of parties that have come out against these draft legislation suggests that there are as of now nearly 100 MPs opposing them. There is no clarity about the stand of some small parties which have around a dozen members put together.Since the Modi government assumed office for its second time in 2019, its rivals have not been able to scuttle any of its major bills due to a rise in the ranks of treasury benches and a corresponding fall in the opposition ranks.The Farmers\\'\\' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill were passed by Lok Sabha on Thursday, while the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill was passed on Tuesday.These bills seek to replace ordinances already promulgated by the government.With opposition parties dubbing the three bills as \"anti-farmers\" and the SAD quitting his government to protest them, Modi refuted their criticism, describing these proposed laws as \"historic\" and stating that they will unshackle farmers by allowing them to sell their produce anywhere at a better price.A day after resigning from Union Cabinet, senior SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said she feels \"saddened\" that her voice in support of farmers was not heard and demanded that the government should pause on these legislations by referring them to a parliamentary panel for wider consultations.The government has presented these bills as pro-farmers, saying these will ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce and do not get subjected to regulations of \\'\\'mandis\\'\\'.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said on Thursday in Lok Sabha that farmers will be free to sell their produce to anyone and these bills will increase competition and promote private investment, which will help in the development of farm infrastructure and generate employment.However, opposition parties have slammed the bills as \"anti-farmers\", claiming that the agriculture sector will be left to the fate of corporate interests.Delhi Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal also appealed to all non-BJP parties to unite in Rajya Sabha and oppose the three bills that he claimed would leave farmers in the hands of big companies for exploitation.At a meeting of the business advisory committee of Lok Sabha, which has floor leaders of all parties besides the government representatives and is chaired by the Speaker, most political parties favoured curtailment of the session, which started on September 14 and was scheduled to conclude on 1 October.A final decision will be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs.Parliament Proceedings on SaturdayOnÂ\\xa0Saturday, the Lok Sabha passed the Taxation Amendment Bill after a detailed debate in which allegations of corruption flew across Opposition and Treasury benches.The Lower House also passed the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2020, in an extended session.The Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020, passed by the Lok Sabha includes extending deadlines for filing returns and for linking PAN and Aadhaar as well as allows for donations made to the PM CARES Fund to claim 100 percent deduction in taxable income.The Bill will replace the ordinanceÂ\\xa0promulgated by the Centre in March.Meanwhile, the Rajya Sabha passed two bills â\\x80\\x94 theÂ\\xa0Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill, and the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill.Additionally, MoS Labour and Employment, Santosh Kumar Gangwar, introduced three bills in the Lok Sabha â\\x80\\x94 The Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020, The Industrial Relations Code, 2020, and The Code On Social Security, 2020.',\n",

However, the Centre has maintained that the MSP system will continue.Calling the bills a \"death warrant\" for farmers, Congress MPÂ\\xa0Partap Singh Bajwa said, \"These Bills are ill-conceived and ill-timed and the Congress opposes it.\"\"Farmers are not illiterate. They understand that this is a way to do away with MSP. Once this is passed, corporate houses will take over farmlands,\" he said.Brien pointed out that the Centre had promised a double income for farmers by 2022. \"But at the current rate, it not double even by 2028\", he added. How many BJP MPs have read these two bills, he quipped.BJP\\'s ally in Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK, also questioned the bills and said that big companies will be able to take over large portions of land through provisions in the legislations. Party MP SR Balasubramoniyan added that \"a farmer will be reduced to a farm worker,\" The Hindu reported.Another ally of the BJP, the Shiromani Akali Dal, which was at odds with the saffron party over the bills in the Lok Sabha, also opposed its provisions in the Upper House.SAD MP Naresh Gujral said, \"There is a trust deficit or communication gap which is reflected in the contents of the bills, which is why we are telling this party to send it to select committee.\"Party leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal had resigned from the Narendra Modi Cabinet on 17 September in protest of the bills being introduced in the Lok Sabha.Meanwhile, Congress MP Anand Sharma replied to criticism from the BJP over the Sonia Gandhi-led party having similar provisions in their 2019 Lok Sabha election manifesto.He was quoted by The Hindu as saying that \"the Congress party had proposed measures to protect farmers and MSP. But, BJP MPs have selectively picked two points from the manifesto and is accusing Congress of hypocrisy\".The YSRCP and the ruling party\\'s Bihar ally, JD(U), supported the bills in the Upper House.In his interrupted reply to the debate, Tomar sought to allay fears over the provision of MSP being overwritten by the new bills.\"Not just these Bills, many steps have been taken to double farmers\\' income in the past six years. There is no need to doubt that farmers will continue to get MSP,\" he said.During the period in which the Upper House was shortly adjourned, O Brien tweeted a video from the central hall of the Parliament saying, \"They cheated.

We have evidence.\"Lok Sabha discusses COVID-19, FCRASeveral Opposition MPs, including members of the Congress, Samajwadi Party, Shiv Sena, DMK, and TMC slammed the Centre over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lok Sabha on Sunday.The Opposition alleged a failure in the strategy to deal with the coronavirus crisis, saying a sudden lockdown caused hardships to the migrants and the poor, a charge rejected by BJP and its ally JD(U).Meanwhile, ruling party\\'s allies said Modi led the fight against the virus well, by taking states into confidence and several lives were saved by the government\\'s persistent efforts.Initiating the debate on \"COVID-19 pandemic in the country\", Tharoor alleged \"utter mismanagement\" in dealing with the pandemic, saying the country witnessed a \"fundamental breakdown\" in government machinery in the past few months, instead of mature and proactive governance.He said that instead of clearly-communicated protocol and comprehensive strategies on part of the government, the country witnessed a lack of clarity, readiness and preparedness to combat the virus.Had the government listened to warning about the virus made by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and others, the situation would have surely been managed better, Tharoor said.The ruling dispensation, Tharoor earlier said, continued to delay the implementation of a national strategy to stop the spread of the virus.\"This was the first failure of the government,\" he said.The failure to adequately recognise the scale and complexity of the problem compounded their unwillingness to listen to the voices that warned well in advance of the consequences of ignoring the problem of such magnitude, he said.When the number of cases were comparatively low in India there was still time for the government to execute comprehensive strategy to curbÂ\\xa0 it, he said. \"It is moral responsibility of any government to take the nation into confidence and not leave them in dark.\"He also said that due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, the country\\'s economy is in a bad shape now, and added arrangements were not made to fight with the virus.If the migrant workers were allowed to go to their hometowns in the beginning, the current situation would have not arisen, he said.The government should have taken the nation into confidence which it did not do as a result the nation \"is losing confidence in you (government)\", he said.DMK\\'s Dayanidhi Maran also slammed the government for its alleged failure in creating enough health infrastructure in the country during the lockdown.He said when the first case was detected in February, the government allegedly did not take initiatives to fight the virus and instead \"it was busy gathering people\" for the US President Donald Trump\\'s Gujarat visit.\"When the lockdown was announced, people got just four hours to prepare. There was no planning. The states were not informed, the way demonitisation was announced in 2016. There was chaos everywhere,\" he added.In an apparent reference to the Tablighti Jamaat incident in Delhi where scores of people tested positive, Maran criticised the government for \"blaming\" Muslims for the initial spread of COVID-19 in the country.Rebutting the criticism, BJP member Kirit Solanki highlighted various welfare schemes announced by the Modi government and said the poor and downtrodden were provided free foodgrains and cash incentives during the lockdown and afterwards.Solanki said the country has so far tested five crore people for coronavirus of which 1.5 crore tests were conducted in the last two weeks.The BJP member pointed out that 33 crore poor people were given Rs 31,235 crore through the direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and the beneficiaries include farmers, women and senior citizens.Without naming anyone, Solanki said a leader was tweeting on ways to deal with the virus, but he is not present in the House to debate on the issue.A bill seeking to amend the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), under which providing the Aadhar numbers of the office-bearers of any NGO will be mandatory for registration and public servants will be barred from receiving funds from abroad, was also introduced in the Lower House.The Foreign Contribution Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2020, introduced in the Lok Sabha by Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai, also proposes to enable the Centre to allow an NGO or association to surrender its FCRA certificate.Introducing the bill, Rai said, \"There would be no discrimination. The permission which was given earlier to religious institutions for foreign contributions under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 will continue. But these institutions should not deviate from their objective and not be a threat to the country\\'s security.\"The draft bill proposes that not more than 20 percent of the total foreign funds received could be spent on administrative expenses.Presently, the limit is 50 percent.Manish Tewari of the Congress objected to the bill and made a request to the government to relax the provisions of the FCRA. Saugata Roy of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) also opposed the bill, saying it is an attempt to stop foreign contributions.\"The idea should be to deregulate and not over-regulate foreign contributions,\" he said.With inputs from PTI',\n",

       " 'By Govindraj EthirajMumbai: The total number of COVID-19 cases in India has now crossed the 5 million mark. In Mumbai, the number is now over 175,000 with over 8,200 deaths. The hospital beds in the city, particularly in intensive care units, seem to be under much greater pressure than they were until a few weeks ago. Why is this happening? How is the administration responding to this?Indiaspend spoke to Gautam Bhansali, a specialist in general medicine and infectious diseases at Bombay Hospital in south Mumbai. He is also the chief coordinator between the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, the civic body, and the private hospitals in the city for managing the beds.Edited excerpts:Why is it that after a few months, we are suddenly seeing a sudden pressure on hospital beds, including intensive care units?We were in a much better position in July and August. In September, we have definitely seen a big surge in the number of cases. There are two or three reasons for it: One is that the lockdown has almost entirely been relaxed, and people are also coming from other places for treatment. Due to that, you could say, it is like a second wave--cases have increased in Mumbai. But we need to understand why the lockdown was enforced. It was to educate people, spread awareness as to what is to be done to fight COVID-19. It is a new disease, a new challenge and a new learning for everybody. Meanwhile, we needed to prepare health infrastructure. Our health infrastructure was not ready when this disease struck us, around March. We needed to create negative pressure in the ICUs and in the ward, set up different entry and exit points (for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients).Now that the number of cases has increased, we are totally geared up with enough beds. There was some shortage of beds in between. We closed down some nursing homes one month back because there were some issues there--complaints of overcharging and high mortality rate. Those issues have been almost sorted out.You are talking about those 73 nursing homes that were taken off COVID-19 duty. Of these, 27 have now been reopened. Is that correct?On 14 September, we had a meeting with the municipal commissioner and the chief minister--as the number of cases has increased, and we assume that the number is going to increase further. Plus, there is an influx of patients from other places too--from Sangli, Dhule, Kolhapur, Nasik, Pune, etc. Cases are coming to Mumbai from all over the state. People want to get treated in Mumbai because they feel Mumbai has better health infrastructure, best doctors, skilled health professionals and that they will get the best treatment. So, we opened the 27 nursing homes, which have more than 25 beds each. They are well regulated, have MD doctors (with advanced medical degrees) and critical care specialists.If you have 100 beds, for instance, how many are now occupied by people from outside Mumbai?About 30 percent to 40 percent of the people admitted in these hospitals--nursing homes and big private hospitals--are from outside the Mumbai metropolitan region--from Bhiwandi, Thane, Kalyan, Dombivli, Navi Mumbai, Ulhasnagar, etc.And what would that number be for pre-COVID times--for instance, at this time last year?People come to Mumbai for treatment from across the country, and from other countries as well, because Mumbai has the best health infrastructure, especially in private hospitals. So, Mumbai is also a destination for medical tourism. So, last year at this time, about 60% to 70% of patients would have been from other parts of the country and abroad.But now, with COVID-19, we are facing a different situation, which needs different bed arrangement, management etc., which is why it is a problem when 30 percent to 40 percent of COVID-19 beds are occupied by people from outside Mumbai.There is a misconception that all industries have collapsed, except the hospital industry â\\x80\\x94 which (people think) is flourishing. But hospitals, mainly private hospitals, are in a big loss--because of the COVID-19 situation, the rate is capped by the government. We cannot charge more than that. There are not many non-COVID-19 patients.So proportionately today, you have a much higher ratio of patients coming from outside Mumbai, which is placing a load on the system because a fair number of beds are dedicated only for COVID-19. Is that correct?Correct. For instance, in Bombay Hospital, we have two buildings--one for COVID, and one for non-COVID. The COVID building is always full. In the non-COVID building, people have started coming now. Earlier, they were in panic; they did not want to go to a hospital for fear of catching COVID-19. People are coming now, but still surgeries are only emergencies; a few elective surgeries are going on.So, if a patient were to have a non-COVID situation, they are likely to get a bed, even in an ICU, in Mumbai?Yes, non-COVID is totally open. There are beds. There is no problem with availability of beds for the non-COVID patients.What is the total number of beds you are managing, in a way, in the private hospital space in Mumbai?Right now, in the 33 big private hospitals--like Bombay Hospital, Breach Candy, Hinduja, Lilavati, Jaslok, etc â\\x80\\x94 we have 2,600 COVID-19 beds. Of these, 1,600 are oxygenated beds, and 590 ICU beds. In the 27 nursing homes we opened, we added 390 ICU beds and 1,700 oxygenated beds. In the government hospitals, we reduced the capacity of COVID beds because we opened up the non-COVID part also. For instance, Nair hospital was totally a dedicated COVID hospital. Now, 50 percent beds are for COVID and 50 percent for non-COVID.But we have increased capacity in our jumbo facilities. We have 11,000 oxygenated beds in these facilities--like in NSCI Worli, BKC, NESCO, Dahisar, Mulund. Jumbo facilities are not isolation or quarantine centres. They are full-fledged hospitals, with oxygenated beds, ventilators, bi-pap machines, nasal cannula machine, X-ray, sonography, 2D echo and a pathology lab in every facility. They have all kinds of medication â\\x80\\x94 including the likes of] remidesivir, tocilizumab â\\x80\\x94 and it is totally free of cost.We inspected the jumbo facilities to understand why people are not coming. There is a perception that these are only quarantine or isolation centres. As I said, they are full-fledged hospitals. Secondly, they feel the doctors may not be good. All the jumbo facilities will now be run by government medical college and hospital staff--like Sion, Nair and KEM hospitals. They already deployed two units each--each unit has 40-50 doctors. Further, all jumbo facilities will be monitored by big private hospitals--Bombay Hospital and Breach Candy will monitor the NSCI Worli Dome. Lilavati and Hinduja, which have top expert doctors, will look after the BKC jumbo facility. NESCO Goregaon facility will be looked after by Kokilaben and Nanavati hospitals. Mulund facility will be looked after by Fortis Hospital.Are there enough doctors and nurses to manage the patients in private hospitals, nursing homes and the jumbo facilities?Yes, in private hospitals and nursing homes, there is no shortage of doctors. In government [MCGM or Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai] hospitals too, there was no shortage of doctors and nurses. The only staff and manpower shortage we were facing was in the jumbo facilities. That is why we deployed medical college and hospital staff in these facilities. Further, we deployed top expert doctors from the private hospitals for ICU care. So from yesterday, there is no shortage of any staff in the jumbo facility.As an infectious disease specialist, looking at the patient flow, and at the condition in which they are coming to the hospital today, what is your sense on where we are in terms of management of this disease?This is a new disease, there are new challenges and learnings everyday. Every day, we change our guidelines. Sometimes we say that patients who are above 50 years should be hospitalised. Sometimes again, we say that for asymptomatic patients, home isolation is better.We are seeing that the virulence of this disease has decreased. Now, patients are not as critical as they were during April-June. That was a horrible time. Maybe patients are educated enough, they are keeping their diabetes controlled, taking enough precautions--and now, enough medications such as remdesivir are available. That definitely helps us a lot--it does not stop the virus, but reduces the viral load. So I feel, with the availability of medications, beds and oxygen, [we are able to manage better]. Oxygen is more important than a ventilator. Every patient does not need a ventilator.You are saying that most additional load that we are seeing, particularly in the ICUs, is because of patients coming from outside Mumbai. Is that likely to reduce or increase? And therefore, are we back to a situation like we had in May or June, even as the disease itself does not spread as much, but the patient load is continuing to rise?I feel the patient load will continue to rise till the end of September. After that, things will settle down. After the first week of October, I think the number of cases may decrease. But if it increases, we are totally geared up with the facilities. We have (enough) beds. In the jumbo facilities, 30-40 percent beds are still vacant; in private hospitals, 10-20 percent beds are vacant; in ICUs, 1-3 percent beds are vacant. It does not mean they are vacant all the time; but there is constant turnover.Earlier, we were doing only 4,000 tests per day in Mumbai. Mumbai is the first city to allow tests without a doctorâ\\x80\\x99s prescription. Now everyday, we are doing 15,000 to 16,000 tests. We are chasing the virus. We are not worried about the numbers. We want to decrease the mortality rate and we are able to decrease it.',\n",
       " 'Farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are peeved at being blamed for Delhiâ\\x80\\x99s smog. â\\x80\\x9cWe have been burning crop residue for the past 50 years now,â\\x80\\x9d said a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union from Haryana, who does not want to be named. â\\x80\\x9cIf anybody is affected, it should be the surrounding villages. We donâ\\x80\\x99t face any such problem. So why is this problem in Delhi seen just during these past few years?â\\x80\\x9dEvery winter, not just Delhi but also large parts of north India are frequently enveloped in a thick blanket of smog, caused by air pollution from vehicular and industrial emissions mixing with fog. The burning of post-harvest paddy stubble in the agricultural fields of Haryana and Punjab is often cited as a major cause of this unhealthy smog.This year, health experts fear that the effects of COVID-19, which primarily causes respiratory problems, would be worsened by heightened air pollution due to smog and smoke from the annual stubble burning.According to a report by The Energy Resource Institute (TERI), last year, from October to December, air pollution in New Delhi and other cities in north India was up to 20 times higher than the safe threshold levels defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO).It is estimated that Punjab produces 20 million tonnes of rice stubble, 80 percent of which is burnt. According to the TERI report, due to labour shortages during COVID-19, paddy transplantation date was advanced to 10 June this year. However, this is unlikely to contain stubble burning. Why burnFarmers resort to burning of crop residue due to the short time window available to sow the next wheat crop. Traditionally, older farmers in Punjab and Haryana recall, very little paddy was sown as wheat, not rice, is the staple diet in the region. However, with the advent of the Green Revolution, a rice-wheat crop rotation has become the norm, under which specialised short-duration varieties were introduced.Rice is grown between June and October, followed by wheat from November to April. Any delay in sowing of wheat adversely affects crop yield. As farmers get barely 20-25 days between the two crops, the easiest way to clear the field is burning the crop residue instead of the more time-consuming mechanical route. Which is also quite expensive, say farmers.In 2013, under the Air Act, 1981, the Punjab government banned the burning of crop residue in the fields. Later, in 2015, the National Green Tribunal prohibited the burning of paddy straw while directing the government to help farmers manage the paddy straw using specialised equipment like Happy Seeder that chops paddy straw, sows wheat seeds and layers the straw as a mulch. Other machines like Rotavator, that bundle the straw into bales to be transported, were also to be procured and used.Punjab Agriculture department officials said about 20,000 pieces of farm equipment were supplied to Punjab farmers in 2019 under a centrally sponsored scheme to promote mechanisation. In the previous year, 28,000 machines were given out. Despite that, according to official data, Punjab witnessed over 22,000 incidents of stubble burning till November 2019.Machines of contentionAs a solution for the current year, the Punjab and Haryana governments submitted an Action Plan to a Supreme Court mandated panel to check stubble burning. The plan promises farmers easier accessibility to machinery that manages crop residue.But with just a few weeks to go before the fields are cleared post-harvest for the kharif, or winter, wheat sowing, there appears to be little momentum to implement this Action Plan. Especially as no systems are yet in place to enable farmers to hire machines at affordable rates.As things stand, it seems it will be business as usual, particularly with the state governments forced to use available personnel and resources in battling the pandemic.â\\x80\\x9cThe paddy crop is still standing which we will begin harvesting next month,â\\x80\\x9d says Ekta Sukhdev Singh, a farmer in Kukarikalan village of Punjab. â\\x80\\x9cWe have to begin sowing wheat in December but as of now, no arrangements have been made for any stubble clearing machinesâ\\x80\\x9d.Under the Action Plan, the two state governments are to set up more Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) to rent out machinery to farmers who cannot afford to buy the high-end machinery, besides supplying more balersâ\\x80\\x94a machine used to compress stubble into compact bales.Punjab claims it has set up 7,378 CHCs over the past two years and has announced another 5,200 CHCs will be set up this year to meet the target of having one CHC in each village. Haryana has set up 2,879 CHCs and 2,000 more will be established by October, the government has said.CHCs are machine banks that rent out expensive machines to farmers, who cannot afford to buy them. The CHCs generally comprise cooperative societies, private entrepreneurs, informal farmersâ\\x80\\x99 groups or FPOs (Farmer Producer Organisations). The machines, which are rented out to farmers, are bought at a subsidised cost.The machines donâ\\x80\\x99t come cheap. A Super Seeder costs Rs 2.1 lakh; Happy Seeder Rs 1.5-1.75 lakh; Rotavator Rs 1.15 lakh; Mulcher Rs 1.7 lakh; MB Plough Rs 2 lakh; and Baler Rs 14 to 20 lakh. But the CHCs get financial assistance of 80 per cent from the Centre.The Union government has also launched a multilingual mobile app, CHC Farm Machinery to help farmers hire machinery from CHCs located within 50 km radius of their farms.Where does the money go?The Centre launched a scheme, â\\x80\\x9cPromotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the State of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh & NCT of Delhiâ\\x80\\x9d with a total outgo of Rs 1151.80 crore for the period 2018-19 to 2019-20. During 2019-20, funds amounting to Rs 273.80 crore, Rs 192.06 crore and Rs 105.29 crore have also been released to the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, respectively.In its 2020-21 Budget announced on February 28th, Haryana government allocated Rs 454 crore for management of crop residue. Besides, last month, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal introduced a comprehensive Rs 1,304 crore plan for crop residue management. The Punjab government allocated Rs 20 crore for crop residue management for the fiscal 2020-21.The machines need an around 45 hp (horse power) tractor to operate, working at a rate of 0.25-0.35 hectares per hour. Their operating constrains include a lower machine capacity as compared to conventional seed drills and inability to operate in wet straw.For the small farmers, the cost of hiring the machine is steep. Moreover, there is no standardized rental rate. Farmers can end up paying anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000 per acre. For the farmers it makes more sense to pay a fine of Rs 2,500 on paddy burning than hire a machine.â\\x80\\x9cFarmers are in favour of deploying the machines as burning stubble leads to a massive loss of natural productive elements, such as micro-organisms and useful worms and insects, which get burnt in the process,â\\x80\\x9d says Sukhdev Singh, a member of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). â\\x80\\x9cMoreover, precious organic material also gets burntâ\\x80\\x9d.Environmental scientists estimate that for every acre of land where paddy straw is burnt, there is a loss of 5.5 kg ofnitrogen, 2.3 kg phosphates, 25 kg potassium and about two tonnes of manure. As for emissions, about three tons of carbon dioxide, 120 kg of carbon monoxide, six kg of particulate matter, four kg of sulphur dioxide, and 400 kg of ash are released per acre.â\\x80\\x9cSystems should also be in place to sell the straw or stubble, which can be used in a variety of ways, from electricity generation and manure to manufacture of furniture, bedding material, flooring and tiles,â\\x80\\x9d added Sukhdev Singh. â\\x80\\x9cA farmer cannot be expected to go about selling the stubble. Mechanisms that make economic sense for farmers and factories would be win-win for allâ\\x80\\x9d.Operational challengesVarious experts have recommended a holistic approach to tackle this problem. While mechanised management of crop residue is needed, it should make economic sense.â\\x80\\x9cWe should stop blaming the farmers, instead we should propose methods that are economically and ecologically desirable,â\\x80\\x9d said eminent agricultural scientist Dr MS Swaminathan in an e-mail response. â\\x80\\x9cSince the organic matter content of our soils is low, I have recommended that the rice straw, which is being burnt in Punjab and Haryana, should be incorporated in the soil to improve both soil physics and moisture holding capacityâ\\x80\\x9d.CHC as a concept is not new, says Chandrakant Pradhan, Lead-Climate Change Resilience, CII Foundation. Over the last two years, Punjab has been setting them up through cooperative societies, which are encouraged to buy machines at a subsidized cost and rent them out to farmers. Entrepreneurs, informal farmersâ\\x80\\x99 groups and FPOs (Farmer Producer Organisations) are also eligible to set up CHCs.Haryana is promoting CHCs mostly through entrepreneurs or through informal groups of farmers. â\\x80\\x9cSuccess of the scheme this season, however, will primarily depend on how effectively demand for large scale use of machines is created,â\\x80\\x9d Pradhan said.According to ICAR, Punjab is likely to see paddy cultivation in around 27 lakh hectares (ha) this season. This is down from 31 lakh ha last year. The state average productivity is about 3.9 tonnes/ha. Around 200 lakh tonnes of paddy straw is generated per year.Haryana has about 13 lakh ha under rice cultivation. The stateâ\\x80\\x99s average productivity is about 3.1 tonnes/ha. Around 12 lakh tonnes of paddy straw is generated every year in the state.The operational challenges vary depending upon the ownership structure. Sukhdev Singh said big farmers hire most of the machines. â\\x80\\x9cFarmers with 2-4 acre land holdings are left out,â\\x80\\x9d he said.Corroborating this, Pradhan said private CHCs tend to associate mostly with farmers with large land holdings, who have the resources to pay the hiring charges. Such farmers come together to form CHCs and once they get the subsidy benefit on the machines they keep the machines for their own use and do not rent them out to others, which defeats the whole purpose of the CHC.â\\x80\\x9cIt is not yet clear whether the CHC is a viable business model in the long run,â\\x80\\x9d adds Pradhan. â\\x80\\x9cThe capital cost requirement is significant even after subsidy. Considering that O&M (operation and maintenance) cost is also high, it remains to be seen how the business model play out in the long runâ\\x80\\x9d. Cost deterrentQuality and after sales services are the other sticky issues. But the main deterrent is the high cost of the machines, even with the subsidy. â\\x80\\x9cTypically, a cooperative would require 6-10 machines, for which they need to pay about Rs 5-6 lakh after subsidy,â\\x80\\x9d says Pradhan.â\\x80\\x9cWe have been giving a subsidy of 50 percent to individual farmers and 80 percent to cooperative societies for buying farm machines,â\\x80\\x9d an official said. The National Green Tribunal order had directed the government to supply machinery free of cost to farmers owning less than two acres of land.However, farmers are demanding a bonus of around Rs 200 per quintal or Rs 3,000 per acre while procuring paddy, as incentive to those who do not burn stubble. Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had last year written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a compensation of Rs 100 per quintal of paddy as incentive.â\\x80\\x9cOur demand is Rs 5,000 per acre,â\\x80\\x9d said Sukhdev Singh, adding that last yearâ\\x80\\x99s compensation had not yet been given. The way forwardâ\\x80\\x9cWe always adopt the â\\x80\\x98donâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x99 philosophy and not the â\\x80\\x98doâ\\x80\\x99 philosophy, which I have been advocating for a long time,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr MS Swaminathan. Farmers would like to remove the rice stubble on time for sowing wheat. One way, Swaminathan points out, is the environmentally destructive method of burning the straw in the field leading to smog. The other is to find economic use of the straw.â\\x80\\x9cWhile Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh are rich in rice straw, it is not used as animal fodder, while states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka lack enough animal feed. It will be ideal if the fodder deficient states tie up with Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh. It could be a win-win situation both for the farmers and for the environment,â\\x80\\x9d he said.â\\x80\\x9cProviding machinery is just one part of the solution,â\\x80\\x9d adds Pradhan. â\\x80\\x9cFarmers also need training to run these machines to get optimum results. Lack of such training discourages farmers from using these machines as they donâ\\x80\\x99t get desired results.â\\x80\\x9dAll of this means Delhi is unlikely to get any relief from burning, smoke and smog this year too.This article was first published in Citizen Matters, a civic media website and is republished here with permission.

       " 'Chandigarh: The Bharatiya Kisan Union\\'s Haryana unit will hold a statewide protest against the Centre\\'s farm bills on Sunday during which they will block roads for three hours, even as Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar appealed for deferring the stir and invited them for talks.Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh said the Centre did not withdraw the three agriculture-related ordinances and instead presented them as bills during the ongoing session of Parliament. The bills have been passed in the Lok Sabha.\"We had warned the government not to go ahead with these \\'anti-farmer\\' legislations. Tomorrow, we will be holding a protest across the state during which we will block roads for three hours. However, the GT road (national highway) will not be blocked,\" he said on Saturday, adding that they have support from other farmer outfits.He also said that farmers from Haryana and Punjab will start a movement against the anti-farmer measures which will later intensify into pan-India protests.On 10 September, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) along with some other farmer outfits had held a protest in Kurukshetra\\'s Pipli against the farm ordinances. The BKU leader also demanded that all cases registered against the protesting farmers on 10 September be withdrawn.In an official statement, Khattar urged the farmers to defer the agitation and invited them for discussion.Reiterating his government\\'s commitment towards protection of farmers\\' interests, the chief minister said on one hand, everyone in a democracy has the right to express their views, on the other hand, maintaining peace in the state is also the utmost duty of any government.He asserted that the farm reforms are in the interest of farmers.\"It is unfortunate to see that the Opposition parties have blatantly politicised the issue to achieve their vested interests by misleading the farmers.\"Being the son of a farmer, I urge the farmers to remember the appeal made by Deenbandhu Chaudhary Chhotu Ram wherein he said that they should recognise their enemies,\" the statement quoted Khattar as saying.Khattar said those who are spreading confusion about the farm bills in such times are the ones who are the \"real enemies\" of farmers and are just trying to serve their own political interests rather than having any concern about peasants.\"If the farmers\\' interest had been at all affected by these farm reforms, I would have been the first person to oppose them,\" he said.He also reiterated that the \\'mandi\\' system and minimum support price (MSP) mechanism were here to stay.Meanwhile, the state government issued directions to ensure law and order and minimise inconvenience to the people of the state during the protest from 12 noon to 3 pm on Sunday.An official spokesperson said deputy commissioners of police, inspector generals (IGs) and superintendents of police (SPs) have been directed to reach out to farmer leaders and ensure a peaceful protest.He said all executive magistrates and police officers have been asked to remain present in the districts and not to proceed on leave.\"Executive magistrates have been directed to remain stationed along with their police counterparts at all such places where congregation of protestors is anticipated. Besides this, joint patrolling of the national and state highways or important roads should be conducted by the executive magistrates along with police officials from September 19 itself so as to instill a sense of confidence amongst citizens,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.The chief minister said if the farmer associations still go ahead with the agitation, they should ensure that least inconvenience is caused to common citizens.He urged that special care should be taken to ensure no obstruction in the way for any patient going to hospital, pregnant women and vehicles supplying essential commodities.Khattar also asked the protestors of being vigilant against \"anti-social elements\" who try to spread violence during such protests.Reacting to the protest call, Haryana home minister Anil Vij said all arrangements have been made to ensure that vehicular movement on highways is not disrupted during the agitation.He also appealed to farmers not to block any highway.',\n",
       " 'New Delhi: Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday said minimum price or MSP based procurement of agriculture crops from farmers will continue and is not related to the farm bills that seek to give cultivators freedom to market their produce.Days after their passage in the Lok Sabha, Tomar introduced the Farmer\\'\\'s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 in the Rajya Sabha.The bills are facing staunch Opposition from farmer bodies as well as from within the ruling coalition. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the food processing minister from the Shiromani Akali Dal party, resigned from the government last week.KK Ragesh (CPI), Derek O\\'Brien (TMC), Trichi Siva (DMK) and K C Venugopal (Congress) moved resolutions for sending the two bills to a select committee of the House for consideration before they are taken up for passage.Speaking at the introduction, Tomar said the two bills are \"historic and will bring a revolutionary change in farmers\\' lives\".They seek to remove restrictions on marketing farm products and allow cultivators to engage with private companies to sell their crops.\"Farmers will get the freedom to sell their produce at any place and person of their choice,\" he said adding the bills were brought after feedback from stakeholders that the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) were not doing justice to farmers.The bills seek to bring competition and ensure fair price to farmers, he said.\"There are misconceptions being spread about the minimum support price (MSP). MSP is the government\\'\\'s administrative decision and not linked to the bills. MSP based procurement was there in the country, is there, and will continue,\" he said.Under MSP, the government guarantees the procurement of crops such as wheat and paddy at minimum prices from farmers.Opposition parties as well as SAD feel the bills are the first step toward removing the MSP which will force the farmers to make distress sales to private companies.Ragesh said the country is witnessing massive agitation by farmers over the bills. \"I request the minister and the government to see the wrath of farmers and withdraw these orders and bills.\"The bills seek to replace emergency ordinances issued earlier.The agri bills, he said, are being dubbed as COVID relief package for farmers but in effect, these are \"package for the corporates\".\"How can it be COVID package? COVID package could have been loan waiver for farmers,\" he said.Agriculture, he said, is a state subject and the union government was \"snatching powers of the states\".He said the bills will be throwing farmers at the mercy of the corporates.Farmers do not have bargaining power and they cannot enter into a contract with corporates from a position of strength, he said.Opponents of the bills see them as an attempt to dilute the country\\'\\'s public procurement system and lead to exploitation by private companies.The Farmers\\' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 seeks to give freedom to farmers to sell their produce outside the notified APMC market yards (mandis). This, the government says, is aimed at facilitating remunerative prices through competitive alternative trading channels.Farmers will not be charged any cess or levy for sale of their produce under this Act, according to the government.It will open more choices for farmers, reduce marketing costs, and help them get better prices. It will also help farmers of regions with surplus produce to get better prices and consumers in areas with shortages at lower prices.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 seeks to give farmers the right to enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters, or large retailers for the sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price.It seeks to transfer the risk of market unpredictability from farmers to sponsors.Tomar said this legislation guarantees cultivators price they negotiate at the time of sowing itself.A third bill, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 that seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion, and potatoes from the list of essential commodities and will do away with the imposition of stock holding limits, is to be moved separately.',\n",

The number increased to a record 32,250 on Friday, an analysis of Delhi government\\'s health bulletins showed.A similar trend was witnessed in June, when the number of active COVID-19 cases rose from 11,555 on 1 June to 28,329 on 27 June. It, however, tapered off to 10,705 active cases by 31 July.On 4 August, it dropped below the 10,000-mark for the first time since 30 May and stood at 9,897, owing to a good recovery rate and less new cases.But just when it seemed the number might drop further, it started rising again with an increase in new cases.Parliament Monsoon Session likely to be curtailed due to COVID-19 spreadThe ongoing monsoon session of Parliament is likely to be curtailed and may end by the middle of next week in view of the threat of the COVID-19 spread among parliamentarians, official sources said on Saturday.At a meeting of the business advisory committee of Lok Sabha, which has floor leaders of all parties besides the government representatives and is chaired by the Speaker, most political parties favoured curtailment of the session, which started on 14 September and was scheduled to conclude on 1 October.After some Members of Parliament, including Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Prahlad Patel, tested positive for COVID-19 during the session, some opposition parties had conveyed to the government that conducting the full 18-day session could be a risky affair, sources told PTI.A final decision will be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs.Centre expresses concern over higher fatality rate in 12 statesExpressing concern over COVID-19 fatality rates in some states being higher than the national average, the Cabinet secretary on Saturday urged 12 states and UTs to analyse mortalities district and hospital-wise to identify critical areas of intervention.

       " 'New Delhi: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the Union labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the government\\'s permission.However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the Union labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of \"this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months\".Apart from this code, two others â\\x80\\x94 Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020 â\\x80\\x94 were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them. These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said.',\n",
       " 'Mumbai: Indian Navy\\'s decommissioned aircraft carrier Viraat on Saturday set sail for the last time, on way to Alang in Gujarat, where it will be broken down and sold as scrap.For Navy veterans who watched the huge vessel being towed away by a tug boat, it was an emotional moment as they stood near the Gateway of India, waving at the once \\'floating town\\', aboard which they spent the best years of their career.As Viraat began its final journey from the Naval dockyard, a Navy helicopter circling overhead provided a majestic backdrop to the vessel\\'s last voyage.A Defence spokesperson said Viraat was to leave for Alang on Friday, but its departure was delayed by a day.The aircraft carrier served the Indian Navy for 29 years before being decommissioned in March 2017. It had served in the UK\\'s Royal Navy as HMS Hermes and was named INS Viraat after being inducted in the Indian Navy in 1987.There were attempts to convert \\'Viraat\\' into a museum or a restaurant, but none of the plans fructified.Alang-based Shree Ram group bought it for Rs 38.54 crore at an auction. Viraat will be dismantled at the Alang ship breaking yard, said company chairman Mukesh Patel.\"The vessel will likely reach Alang by 21 September if weather conditions remain favourable,\" he added.Once the ship arrives, it will require clearances from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and Customs before being brought ashore. Permissions will also be needed for recycling as per the Supreme Court\\'s 2013 guidelines, Patel said.The ship will be scrapped in 9 to 12 months, he said. Prior to being commissioned in Indian Navy on 12 May, 1987, the aircraft carrier had served with UKs Royal Navy for 27 years under the name HMS Hermes, taking it to a total of 56 years of operational service, and making it among the oldest serving warships.Under the Indian flag, Viraat played a crucial role in military operations such as Operation Jupiter, Operation Parakram and Operation Vijay.Viraat was commissioned into Indian Navy at Plymouth in the United Kingdom.For the Indian Navy, Operation Jupiter in July 1989 was Viraat\\'s first major operation, as part of the Indian Peace Keeping operations in Sri Lanka in the wake of the breakdown of the Indo-Sri Lankan accord of 1986.Viraat also saw action during Operation Parakram in 2001-2002, post the terror attack on Parliament.The last operational deployment of the ship was the participation in International Fleet Review at Vishakhapatanam on February 2016.The ship also participated in various international joint exercises like Malabar (with US Navy), Varuna (with French Navy), Naseem-Al-Bahr (with Oman Navy) and was an integral element of annual Theater Level Operational Exercise (TROPEX).Viraat is the second aircraft carrier to be broken down in India. In 2014, Vikrant was broken down in Mumbai.Four officers who served on board Viraat when it was operational, went on to become Indian Navy chiefs.Nicknamed the Grand Old Lady, Viraat could carry a contingent of over 1,500 crew and officers. \"She was like a floating city, a piece of our country wherever we went,\" a former Navy officer said.The warship served the British Navy for 25 years between 1959 and 1984. It was then called HMS Hermes and had played a major role in the Falklands War of 1982.When the Indian Navy acquired the warship in 1986, the British Navy predicted that it would not be in service for more than seven years. But she went on to serve the Indian Navy for nearly 30 years, over four times the predicted life span.Viraat was at sea for a whopping 2,258 days, covering 5,90,000 nautical miles, and 22,622 hours of flying operations, a Defence official said.It could carry 25 aircraft, includingSea Harrier fighters and Sea King 42 B/C, Chetak, Kamov 31 and ALH helicopters.While operational, Viraat weighed about 27,800 tonnes. Its boilers had run for over 80,000 hours and it was probably the only warship, constructed during the World War II, to have served any country for so long, the official said.Many social media users lamented the failure of successive governments to preserve Viraat and another aircraft carrier Vikrant as maritime muesums to depict India\\'s rich naval heritage, instead of allowing them to be broken down and sold as scrap.\"#Viraat Callsign \"Romeo Two Two\" - End of an era, a glorious chapter in the history of @indiannavy.

       " 'On the sixth day of the Monsoon Session of Parliament on Saturday, the Lok Sabha passed the Taxation Amendment Bill after a detailed debate in which allegations of corruption flew across Opposition and Treasury benches.The Lower House also passed the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2020, in an extended session.The Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020, passed by the Lok Sabha includes extending deadlines for filing returns and for linking PAN and Aadhaar as well as allows for donations made to the PM CARES Fund to claim 100 percent deduction in taxable income.The Bill will replace the ordinanceÂ\\xa0promulgated by the Centre in March.Meanwhile, the Rajya Sabha passed two bills â\\x80\\x94 theÂ\\xa0Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill, and the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill.Additionally, MoS Labour and Employment, Santosh Kumar Gangwar, introduced three bills in the Lok Sabha â\\x80\\x94 The Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020, The Industrial Relations Code, 2020, and The Code On Social Security, 2020.PM CARES fund lacks transparency, says OppositionIn the Lok Sabha, Opposition MPs of the Congress, DMK, TMC, and others opposed the Prime Minister\\'s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund, alleging that it lacked transparency.ThisÂ\\xa0charge was rejected by Union Minister Anurag Thakur, who hit back at the main Opposition party and alleged thatÂ\\xa0government departments had given donations to trusts run by the Gandhi family during the UPA\\'s tenure.They were participating in a debate on the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020. The Bill seeks to bring inÂ\\xa0various compliance relief measures for taxpayers, including extending time limits for filing returns, in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.The Bill also includes tax benefits for donations to the PM CARES Fund.Â\\xa0The Bill amends the provisions of the Income Tax Act to provide the same tax treatment to PM CARES Fund as available to the Prime Minister\\'s National Relief Fund (PM-NRF).\"The donation made to the PM CARES Fund shall be eligible for 100 percent deduction under Section 80G of the IT Act. Further, the limit on deduction of 10 percent of gross income shall also not be applicable for donation made to PM CARES Fund,\" an official statement had said.The Bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha on Friday, also proposes to extend the faceless assessment scheme to at least eight processes in Income Tax law. It proposed faceless assessment of income escaping assessment, rectification, amendments and issuance of notice or intimation.Initiating the debate on the Bill in the Lower House,Â\\xa0RSP\\'s NK Premachandran said, \"I can\\'t understand the logic to have a separate fund. What is the difference between the Prime Minister\\'s National Relief Fund and the PM CARES Fund.\"He alleged the PM CARES Fund \"lacks transparency as it is not audited by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)\". He said, \"The question of transparency and accountability is the main issue I want to highlight.\"Congress\\' Manickam Tagore also raised the issue of transparency in the fund. He questioned whetherÂ\\xa0a chief minister of any state can say that he or she will not disclose the spending under the Chief Minister\\'s Relief Fund. \"But PM CARES Fund is outside the ambit of the Parliament and the CAG,\" he added.\"What was the need of a private trust with the Council of Ministers as trustees? It indicates a conflict of interest,\" Tagore said.He alleged that just like demonetisation, the Narendra Modi government is providing another opportunity \"to convert blackmoney into white\".Without naming anyone, he said the \"AA battery\" is running the Central Government which is why \"most of the government contracts are going to some particular companies\".Echoing similar views, DMK MP Gautham Sigamani Pon alleged that the PM CARES Fund is \"clearly a private trust\".TMC\\'s Mahua Moitra slammed the Centre in the debate on the Bill and said that the government should \"stop lying\" about welfare measures it has taken.Opposing the Bill, sheÂ\\xa0said the PM CARES Fund is against public interest as it is not answerable to the Parliament even though it collects funds from the public. She said that 38 public sector companies contributed a total of Rs 2,100 crore to the fund.\"This is 70 percent of the total corpus,\" she said, adding it should therefore be answerable to the Parliament.She also alleged that the fund got money from Chinese firms like TikTok and Huawei and asked whether the CentreÂ\\xa0willÂ\\xa0return the \"tainted\" donations from such \"enemy\" companies.She also echoed the Opposition\\'s question of whether there was a need for another fund.\"Prime Ministers will come and go, but the existence of a fund is not up for discussion? What is this need to name everything after one individual?\" she said.Backing the fund, BJD\\'s Bhartuhari Mahtab expressed hope that theÂ\\xa0PM CARES Fund is not only created to tackle COVID-19 but also for different calamities.\"Such type of calamity relief funds are nothing new in our country. I doubt in any other country such a clamour has been made to target a philanthropic trust, the manner in which it is being done in the country,\" Mahtab said.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena\\'s Arvind Sawant said a similar tax relief should be extended to the fund created by the Maharashtra government.Supporting the Bill, BJP MP Subhash Chandra Baheria said it proposes faceless assessment which is a big step in the interest of taxpayers.Anurag Thakur, Nirmala Sitharaman target Congress in Lok Sabha debateIntervening in the debate on the Taxation Amendment Bill, Thakur asserted that the PM CARES Fund has been brought with \"absolute transparency\".The trustees of PM CARES Fund are the prime minister, the home minster, the finance minister and the defence minster. But in the case of Prime Minister\\'s National Relief Fund (PMNRF), the Congress president was also a member, he said.He asked the Congress members as to why was the Indian National Congress (INC) president a member of PM-NRF, alleging that the PMNRF was controlled by \"a family\".Amid protests by Congress members, Thakur persisted with his attack on the party. He said PM-NRF was formed in 1948 but was not registered under relevant sections of prevailing laws. He also claimed that funds used to be transferred from PM-NRF to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation.He pointed out that Congress had maintained that PM-NRF is a public charitable trust, so that there is no need for an audit by CAG.He also alleged that they took money from Islamist preacher Zakir Naik in 2011 and returned it in 2014. He wondered why it took so long to return the donation. \"Did you return money with interest or without interest?\" he said.Meanwhile, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman replied to arguments with a comparison of the PM CARES and PM-NRF funds.The specifications of the PM CARES and PM-NRF funds are \"similar\", Sitharaman. She also emphasised that while the PM CARES fund is registered, the PM-NRF is not.Many MPs raised concerns over the audit of the PM CARES, because it is outside the ambit of the CAG. In reply, Sitharaman said that both the funds are being audited by a firm, SARC and Associates.She said that neither funds are under the purview of the RTI Act. She added that that objectives of both the funds were also \"similar\".The finance minister also slammed the Opposition over Congress president Sonia Gandhi\\'s inclusion on the board of trustees of the PM-NRF.In reply to the Opposition\\'s arguments on the Companies Amendment Bill, Sitharaman said, \"Bill will help companies to do their business easily. It will also amend companies law to decriminalise various offences.\"Farooq Abullah urges Centre to advocate talks with PakistanNC MP Farooq Abdullah, speaking in Parliament for the first time since his release from detention after the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, advocated talks with Pakistan, saying if India can talk to China to defuse their border row, it can also speak to its other neighbour to deal with the situation at the Union Territory\\'s borders.\"Border skirmishes have been rising and people are dying... A way has to be found to deal with this. Except for talks... As you are talking to China to attempt that it withdraws (from Ladakh border), we should also talk to our (other) neighbour to find a way to get out of this situation,\" he said in Lok Sabha during the Zero Hour amid protests from Treasury Benches.The Srinagar MP also said that Jammu and Kashmir has not seen any progress, adding that authorities blocking 4G facilities in the Union Territory goes against the interest of students and traders.He also conveyed his gratitude to parliamentarians for speaking for him when he was under detention.Ongoing Parliament session likely to be curtailedThe ongoing Monsoon Session of Parliament is likely to be curtailed and may end by the middle of next week in view of the threat of the COVID-19 spread among parliamentarians,Â\\xa0PTI reported.At a meeting of the business advisory committee of Lok Sabha, which has floor leaders of all parties besides the government representatives and is chaired by the Speaker, most political parties favoured curtailment of the session, which started on 14 September and was scheduled to conclude on 1 October.A final decision will be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs.Centre faces heat over migrant crisis in Rajya SabhaIn the Upper House of the Parliament, Opposition parties criticised the Central Government, accusing it of crossing constitutional bars, interfering in the affairs of states, failing to control private hospitals during the coronavirus crisis, and being unable to protect the migrant labourers and the poor.The MPs were participating in a debate on The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill, 2020.Derek O\\'Brien of the Trinamool Congress accused the Centre of interfering in the functioning of states through the Bill.The Bill, which was subsequently passed, provides for jail terms upto five years and hefty fines for attack on healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus outbreak or during any situation akin to the current pandemic.\"Remember states of West Bengal, Punjab, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan rejected you. Chief Ministers there have been elected to run the states. You cannot cross constitutional bars. There are sinister provisions in the Bill. The States must be authorised to take decisions,\" he said.Participating in the debate, K Keshava Rao of the TRS asserted the Centre should consult states before interfering into their affairs.The Samajwadi Party and DMK also echoed critical statements in the debate.Rajya Sabha passes Insolvency Amendment BillMeanwhile, the Rajya Sabha passed amendments to the insolvency law, allowing for suspension of fresh insolvency proceedings for at least six months starting 25 March amid the coronavirus pandemic, with Sitharaman saying a decision on extending the suspension of relevant provisions will be taken next week.In the wake of the COVID-19 situation, the government had decided to suspend the provisions starting from 25 March for six months by promulgating an ordinance in June.Default on repayments from 25 March, the day when the nationwide lockdown began to curb coronavirus infections, would not be considered for initiating insolvency proceedings for at least six months.The six-month period is ending next week.The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020, seeks to replace the ordinance issued in June, was passed by a voice vote after a brief discussion.Replying to the debate, Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the suspension of provisions will end next week.\"At the moment, amendment to the Code gives me a provision to only extend till one year. If at all, because it is coming to an end on 25 September this year, 24 September itself we have to make an announcement about what is going to happen. But even if I do, it means by March it should be ending...,\" the minister said.The minister also clarified that insolvency proceedings against corporates defaulting on loans prior to 25 March will continue and the amendment will not stall those cases.A majority of Opposition parties supported the Bill and also urged the government to provide interest waiver on loans to farmers and poor people suffering due to the COVID-19 crisis.During the debate on the Bill, many members expressed fears over its possible misuse by corporates even as they hoped that it will help in reviving the economy.On members\\' queries regarding liability of personal guarantors in the IBC, Sitharaman said the corporate debtor often has guarantors.With inputs from agencies',\n",
       " 'Parliament LATEST Updates:Â\\xa0Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman responded to the Opposition\\'s arguments on the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2020 in the Lok Sabha on Saturday.She said, \"This Bill will help companies doing their business easily, will help them in ease of leaving. It will also amend companies law to decriminalise various offences.\"The House is adjourned till 3 pm on Sunday.MoS Finance Anurag Thakur addressed arguments made by the Opposition MPs over the PM CARES fund in the Lok Sabha on Saturday.\"Why is there such distrust about PM cares fund? Is there any past experience which has caused it?\"The initial fund was given by PM Modi\\'s mother and other ordinary people. This will be audited by the same group that audits the PM Relief fund. This will be dispensed by a committee and is not person specific. This is a registered trust,\" he said.TMC MP Mahua Moitra added to the debate on the Taxation Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha on Saturday, and slammed the Centre on multiple counts including the donations made by Chinese companies to the PM CARES fund.She said that the bill is \"deeply problematic because it further weakens the rights and resources available to states by taking away statutory promises made under the new GST regime. It also corners the public funds for PM CARES to the direct detriment of state relief funds.\"She added, \"Government allowed CSR to PM CARES, but disallowed to state relief fund, which is an unfair step. Also, 38 PSUs donated to PM CARES, but no audit has been done regarding it.\"\"Massive donations were done by Chinese companies to PM CARES â\\x80\\x94 Xiaomi, TikTok, etc. Why is the government accepting donations from our enemy companies, the tainted money should be returned,\" she added.The Lok Sabha has begun debate on the Taxation Amendment Bill moved by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The introduction of the bill caused lively discussion on the PM CARES fund, GST, and the state of the economy on Friday.MoS Labour and Employment Santosh Kumar Gangwar sought to introduce three bills in the Lok Sabha on Saturday: The Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020, The Industrial Relations Code, 2020, The Code On Social Security, 2020.Giving relief to taxpayers following the COVID-19 outbreak, the government had through the ordinance extended the deadline for filing of income tax returns for 2018-19 fiscal till 30 September and linking biometric Aadhaar with PAN till 31 March, 2021.All issues not included under Epidemic Act or National Disaster Management Act will be included in the Public Health Act, said the Union health minister.Sitharaman told the Rajya Sabha that the suspension of Sections 7, 9 and 10 of IBC was aimed at preventing businesses from getting pushed into insolvency. \"With this intention, Section 10A of the ordinance was brought in,\" said Sitharaman.Congress Vivek Tankha said the enactment of 10A will be counterproductive as there is no certainty in how long the pandemic will continue.Uproar in Rajya Sabha followed as Opposition demanded discussion on Agriculture Bills passed in Lok Sabha. Chairman Venkaiah Naidu said that Bills are to be taken next day, and the discussion can take place then.On the sixth day of the Parliament\\'s Monsoon session, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday will table the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill 2020 for consideration and passing.The Bill will replace the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, which was promulgated on 5 June and prohibited the initiation of insolvency proceedings for defaults arising during the six months from 25 March 2020 (extendable upto one year).The Ordinance came as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had created uncertainty and stress for businesses. It was also felt that during the coronavorus lockdown, it may be difficult to find an adequate number of resolution applicants to rescue the corporate debtor who may default in discharging their debt.Among the ordinances to be discussed in the Upper House is Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance 2020. The Ordinance seeks amendments to the 125-years-old Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, that protects health workers in the country.Earlier in April, the government had approved an ordinance that recognised any crime against health professionals as a \"cognizable and non-bailable\" offence. It means that offenders can be arrested without a warrant, and no bail would be granted.Offenders can also be fined anywhere between Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh and will also have to serve a prison term between three months to five years, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar had said in April.The Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020, is listed to be taken in consideration in the Lower House on Saturday.The Bill seeks to replace the Taxation and other Laws (Relaxation of Certain Provisions) Ordinance, 2020, issued in March 2020.Giving relief to taxpayers following the COVID-19 outbreak, the government had through the ordinance extended the deadline for filing of income tax returns for 2018-19 fiscal till 30 September and linking biometric Aadhaar with PAN till 31 March, 2021.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla called for introduction of the bill on Friday. However, since the minister was not present, the House then took up discussion on two farm sector related legislations.Home Minister Amot Shah will move the Bill seeking to establish a National Forensic Sciences University as an institution of national importance by upgrading the Gujarat Forensic Sciences University in Gandhinagar, be taken into consideration.Parliament proceedings on 18 SeptemberOn Friday, the Lower House witnessed first adjournment in the Monsoon Session over disruption when Treasury and Opposition members clashed over PM-CARES fund.The proceedings in the Lower House were disrupted as the Opposition raised slogans against Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur for his allegation that the PM National Relief Fund (PMNRF) was set up \"only for the benefit of the Gandhi family\".\"The trust was set up during the tenure of former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and was not even registered as a public trust but it got all relevant clearance, including FCRA,\" Thakur said, intervening during the introduction of the Taxation and other Laws (Relaxation of Certain Provisions) Bill.\"The PM Cares Fund is a constitutionally set up public charitable trust. PM National Relief Fund was set up only for the benefits of one family â\\x80\\x94 the Nehru-Gandhi family,\" he said.On the other hand Rajya Sabha passed four Bills in less than four hours. The Upper House too was adjourned for 30 minutes to mourn the death of Karnataka MP Ashok Gasti.The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020; Salaries and Allowances of Ministers (Amendment) Bill, 2020; Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020; and Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill, 2020, were passed in the Upper House.With inputs from PTI',\n",
       " 'New Delhi: The Press Club of India (PCI) on Saturday called the arrest of freelance journalist Rajeev Sharma by Delhi Police \"high-handed\" and alleged that it \"may be inspired by obscure or questionable considerations\".The Delhi Police on Saturday said Sharma was allegedly passing sensitive information about India\\'s border strategy and Army deployment and procurement to Chinese intelligence agencies.Sharma was arrested September 14.In a statement, the PCI demanded that in all cases of arrests of journalists anywhere in the country, \"the police must be required to inform the Press Council of India as well as the self-regulatory body of the broadcast media on an immediate basis\".It also said that the police should provide pertinent details \"so that a defence may be possible to construct\".The PCI said it is \"astounded to hear of the arrest of Rajeev Sharma, a well-known independent journalist of long standing and a member of the club\".\"This is on account of the dubious track record of the Special Cell. More generally also, the record of Delhi Police is hardly a shining one,\" it said.\"On the basis of the statement of the police released to the media, we have no hesitation in saying that the police action is high-handed, and may be inspired by obscure or questionable considerations,\" the PCI alleged.The PCI also cited the instance of Iftikhar Gilani, a senior journalist with Kashmir Times, who was arrested in 2002 \"on the trumped up charge of tracking the Army\\'s movements in Kashmir and keeping his so-called pay masters informed\".Subsequently, a Delhi journalist, who wrote for Iran\\'s official news agency, was also arrested for playing in the hands of the Iranian secret service, the PCI said.\"His family also was made to run from pillar to post â\\x80\\x94 all to no avail. Eventually it became clear that the whole case was bogus and the journalist was freed,\" it said.The PCI statement also said that the arrests of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Jamia Millia Islamia scholars such as Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and others were done \"acting on a political bias\".\"Of late, Delhi Police, including its Special Cell, have made preposterous arrests under the lawless law called UAPA (Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act) in which the word of the government is enough to keep an innocent person behind bars for long periods. These have happened in matters relating to anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protests and the carefully designed communal killings in the so-called February 2020 riots in northeast Delhi,\" the PCI said.The statement said Sharma wrote on strategic affairs and \"may well have accessed routinely over-classified information on the Internet that is in the public domain\".',\n",
       " 'New Delhi: The CBI has filed a supplementary charge sheet against British National Christian Michel James and businessman Rajeev Saxena in the AgustaWestland chopper scam.In its final report filed before Special Judge Arvind Kumar, the CBI has named both alleged middlemen Michel and Saxena, and 13 others.The court is likely to take up the matter for consideration on 21 September.According to the sources, the probe report filed on Friday details the alleged role played by Michel, Saxena and others in bringing bribes for politicians, bureaucrats and Indian Air Force (IAF) officials in India in the scam.The sources said that the agency, which had earlier this year sought sanction from the authorities concerned to prosecute former defence secretary Shashi Kant Sharma, has not named him as an accused since the request is not granted yet.The agency told the court that it may file another supplementary charge sheet in the matter later.The first charge sheet in the case was filed in September 2017 naming former IAF chief SP Tyagi and others.The agency had earlier told the court that \"during the course of investigation, copies of classified/ secret official documents of Indian Air Force (IAF)/ Ministry of Defence (MoD) such as Operational Requirements for VVIP helicopters before issuance of Request of Proposal and other incriminating documents running into more than one lakh pages received from Italy and Switzerland.It had also said that a \"payment sheet\" recovered from Michel, prepared on his dictation, shows that an amount of Euro 30 million was paid/ proposed to be paid to the officers of IAF, MoD, bureaucrats, politicians and family in India for showing favour in the VVIP helicopter deal.\"The applicant had entered into as many as five contracts through two of his firms to legitimise the illicit commission/ kickbacks on the procurement of VVIP helicopters by MoD, India, the CBI said.\"An amount of Euro 42.27 million was paid by the Westland Group Companies to the firms of the applicant as kickbacks/ bribes without undertaking any work against the receipt of such amount,\" it said.It said that out of the kickbacks received from AgustaWestland, Michel further made payments to various persons in India.Michel was taken into custody by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on December 5 last year after his extradition from Dubai, while the ED took him into custody on December 22 last year. He is currently in judicial custody in both cases.Dubai-based businessman Saxena was extradited to India on January 31, 2019 in connection with the scam relating to the purchase of 12 VVIP helicopters from AgustaWestland.While Michel is currently in judicial custody, Saxena is out on bail in the money laundering case filed by ED.ED had earlier arrested Saxena but he was later granted bail after the agency supported his plea to turn approver in the case.The agencies had told the court that Michel made 24.25 million euros and 1,60,96,245 pounds from the now-scrapped AgustaWestland deal.The CBI has alleged that the deal signed in February 2010 to supply VVIP choppers worth 556.262 million euros caused an estimated loss of 398.21 million euros (about Rs 2,666 crore) to the state exchequer.',\n",

It is using drones to drop weapons and narcotics and also push terrorists from both Rajouri and Poonch districts, which had witnessed a spurt in ceasefire violations - almost on a daily basis,\" the DGP said.However, he said the police, Army and other forces are working together to scuttle Pakistan\\'\\'s design and to maintain peace and law and order in the Union Territory.\"We are enjoying good operational synergy and the latest arrest of three LeT terrorists and seizure of a huge cache of arms and ammunition was its result. We received information about movement of some suspicious people and accordingly launched the cordon and search operation,\" he said.He said three people were seen moving with a bag and were challenged but they hurled a grenade, which luckily did not explode and the trio was overpowered.The search of the bag led to the recovery of two AK-56 rifles, two pistols, four grenades and Rs 1 lakh in Indian currency, which had smuggled from Pakistan to escalate violence, Dilbag Singh said it came to light that the consignment was dropped on this side of the LoC by Pakistan using the drone and the trio, who hail from Kashmir, had come to pick up the consignment.\"Their interrogation is underway and further details will be shared later,\" he said.In response to questions, he said Pakistan is doing its best to revive terrorism in the twin districts of Poonch and Rajouri, which falls in Jammu division and were cleared of militancy over a decade back.\"The people of Rajouri and Poonch are peace loving and they will not allow Pakistan to succeed in its design. There are some elements with whom we will deal sternly,\" he said.He termed the dropping of weapons through drones as a \"big challenge\" and said this is the first such aerial drop in the district though a similar attempt was foiled by the Border Security Force (BSF) along the International Border in Kathua district sometime back.\"This is a hilly terrain and drones just bypass the deployment on the LoC,\" he said, adding that \"we are vigilant to the threat and have taken necessary measures\".On the recovery of a large number of US-made rifles in the recent past, the DGP said that \"we have recovered such types of rifles like M-4 and M-16 in large numbers in the past as well. These rifles are duplicate weapons manufactured in Pakistan and are being smuggled by LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists\".The IGP said on September 11, police and Army arrested two people and recovered a cache of arms and ammunition, including three pistols, 11 grenades, improvised explosive device (IED) material and a pen drive, frustrating terrorists plan to carry out target killings and blasts in Poonch district.\"The arrest and recovery was made from Balakote sector of Poonch. The pen drive contains details of assembling and planting the IED,\" he said.In another operation on September 14, one person was arrested with 7 kg heroin in Rajouri and later at his disclosure one more arrest was made from Kulgam district of south Kashmir.Three residents of Poonch were also arrested and their questioning led to the recovery of 4 kg of heroin from the same spot from where the earlier consignment of 7 kg was dumped after smuggling from across the border, he said.The IGP said the money from the heroin was meant to support terrorism.',\n",
       " 'Hyderabad: Alleging that the agriculture bills brought in by the NDA government would cause great injustice to farmers in the country, TRS president and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday asked his party MPs to vote against them in the Rajya Sabha.Observing that the bills would hurt farmers and benefit corporates, Rao told the TRS parliamentary party leader K Keshav Rao to strongly oppose them in parliament.\"Chief Minister Sri K Chandrasekhar Rao said that the Farmers and farming related Bills introduced by the Centre in Parliament would do a lot of injustices to the farm sector in the country.The chief minister has instructed TRSPP Leader Dr K Keshav Rao to oppose the Bills tooth and nail in the Parliament, as it would benefit the corporates and adversely impact the farmers, an official release said.The bills, for public consumption, say that the farmers can sell their produce anywhere in the country, but, in reality, the bills would enable the traders to go anywhere in the country to buy the produce, Rao said.Though the NDA government says that the farmers can sell their produce anywhere in the country, is it possible for farmers to take their small produce to other places, bearing heavy transport charges, he asked.\"These Bills are nothing but a sugar coated pill. This should be opposed at all costs,\" the chief minister said.Rao further said, as on date, there is 50 percent import duty on corn and that the Centre has decided to reduce it by 15 percent.The Centre wanted to import one crore tonnes of corn and about 70 lakh tonnes of corn had already been purchased, he claimed.\"For whose benefit 35 percent of import duty was reduced? When the country is going through economic crisis how did they take such a decision? corn is cultivated in a big way in the country. If we reduce the import duty on corn, what will happen to our own corn producers?\" he asked.Rao said the bills \"should be opposed and voted against in the Rajya Sabha\" since they would cause huge losses to the agriculture sector and are against the interests of farmers in the country.The three agri bills were passed by Lok Sabha this week.TRS has seven members in the Rajya Sabha.',\n",

Also, both the Houses have cleared a bill to replace an ordinance for cutting by 30 per cent the salaries of MPs to ramp up funds in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.After some Members of Parliament, including Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Prahlad Patel, tested positive for COVID-19 during the session, some opposition parties had conveyed to the government that conducting the full 18-day session could be a risky affair, sources said.The government then started thinking in that direction, the sources said.Several MPs had also tested positive for COVID-19 around the time the session began and they were advised not to attend proceedings.In order to prevent the spread of coronavirus within the parliament complex, reporters and parliamentary staff entering the premises now have to undergo the rapid antigen test mandatorily on a daily basis, according to a new protocol put in place.Besides, members of both Houses are undergoing RT-PCR tests on regular intervals on a voluntary basis, said a senior Parliament official.A member of Parliament can undergo the RT-PCR test as many times he or she likes.Journalists covering the monsoon session from press galleries of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha also have the option to undergo the RT-PCR test, which is valid for 72 hours.Since the result of the much reliable RT-PCR test takes time, the antigen test has been made mandatory on a daily basis.Government officials accompanying their respective ministers during the bill discussions also have to show a negative report of RT-PCR test taken within the last 72 hours of their visit to the complex.The session began on September 14 and is slated to end on October 1. Both houses are meeting in shifts of four hours each without the customary Saturday-Sunday weekend break.The Budget Session was short-terminated in March after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.',\n",

       " 'From the two Portuguese students who may have been imprisoned for raising wine glasses in a toast to freedom in 1960, to the treatment meted out to dissenters in India â\\x80\\x94 we have recognised the fragility of citizenship as a construct, be it in a dictatorship or a democracy.The recent arrest of Umar Khalid is being seen as one of the most outrageous steps in a series of sustained attacks on the flag bearers of a certain cause. It might trigger a mobilisation of Muslim intelligentsia to guard against perceived state atrocities, which in turn could lead to a further ghettoisation even at the cognitive level, apart from the already existing social ghettos.A possible downside of this is the gradual diminishing of the canvas of their cause, leading to a conscious â\\x80\\x98narrowisationâ\\x80\\x99 of the political and social umbrella. This carries the risk of perpetuating the agenda of the state.Given the nature of the accusations and arrests, a centralisation of agenda is suspected and it seems that different agencies, existing for different purposes, are following the same agenda â\\x80\\x94 turning means into a faÃ§ade, with the end remaining the same. For the NIA (National Investigation Agency), NATGRID (National Intelligence Grid), local police, and other agencies it seems all roads lead to Rome.The unbridled police action is germane to the idea of a totalitarian state, which is being feared by the Muslim minority the most (apart from the outspoken liberals who are aware of the nature and reactions of such an authoritarian state). The arrest of young Muslim scholars like Umar Khalid is a strong message against Muslim agitators and a step towards nipping in the bud the leadership emerging in the Muslim community. Restricting the Muslim communityâ\\x80\\x99s eloquent scholars might also serve the purpose of breaking the back of the dialogic thought process of the community. It might shrink their space of negotiation with the state and diminish their capacity to articulate their experiences, leading to a loss of vocabulary that demands accountability from the state.The illegitimate opinion making with assistance from media-created experts endorsing the state narrative provides a pretext for withdrawing the rights of the target group of people. The mass audience in general starts to see itself as the instrument of fate destined to perform action against a particular community with support from the discourse that justifies its action. This shifts the balance of citizenship, by increasing the imagined personal importance of the majority community and encouraging self-censorship among the minority community. It deters the target community from demanding anything more than the bare minimum and creates conflicting desires among them, planting the seeds of â\\x80\\x98intra-community mistrustâ\\x80\\x99, which is a commonplace in conflict-torn regions like Kashmir, where the magnified effect of such occurrences are widely evident.Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s vulnerabilities emanate from a conflicted duality that exists beneath a forced delivery of national identity, besides socio-political and economic mandates coming from a highly centralised state. At the social level, the angst of the Muslim community is growing phenomenally. These police actions with effective intelligence gathering, backed by the larger â\\x80\\x98security discourseâ\\x80\\x99 and its insidious encroachment of â\\x80\\x98democratic spaces,â\\x80\\x99 are more telling as signs of shrinking democratic spaces in general, but more evident in matters related to the minority community and the advocates of justice for marginalised groups. The contempt for the Muslim community imbued by the blatancy and lack of accountability on part of the state and its affiliate institutions layers its vulnerabilities on several counts.Institutions like JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University), which have been posing a counter narrative to the governments as well as to social orthodoxy for a long time were the eyesores of certain political and cultural groups. A certain political narrative supported by the conservative right has given a vent to hostility and antagonism targeting not only the scholars from these institutions but also the institutions themselves. What has happened in the last 2-3 years in JNU apropos a range of issues â\\x80\\x94 such as administrative high-handedness, circumvention of recruitment procedures, multifold hike of fees, enhanced monitoring and regulation compared to the past â\\x80\\x94 is not just telling of the antagonism against a set of institutions and the scholars they produce but a larger inimical meta-narrative that is being weaved at the political level with adverse social consequences.The transvaluation of the conception and imposition of criminality has widened to an unprecedented degree. This has led to a siege-mentality among Muslims of India, which is clearly explained by the pre-recorded video put out by Umar Khalid even before his arrest, now circulating in the public domain. The predictability of the pointedness of the state response has affected the Muslim communityâ\\x80\\x99s political participation, education, social wellbeing, decision-making; collectively inducing an existential crisis. As such, Umar Khalidâ\\x80\\x99s arrest is being seen as the cognitive incarceration of Muslim youth.Tarushikha Sarvesh is assistant professor (Sociology) at the Advanced Centre for Womenâ\\x80\\x99s Studies, Aligarh Muslim University',\n",

       " 'The issue of same-sex marriage is finally at our doorstep. LGBTQIA activists have filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, holding by the chin a society which habitually looked away from the subject and gently turning it towards the legal legitimacy of sexual choice. If men and women can marry, why should same-sex partners be denied civil union?It is a fair demand. Intersex activist from Tamil Nadu Gopi Shankar M, journalist Abhijit Iyer-Mitra, transgender activist G Oorvasi, and founder-member of Sakhi, the lesbian archives, Giti Thadani filed a petition at the Delhi high court, appealing that such marriages be conducted under the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 (HMA). They argued that there is nothing in the Act that prohibits same-sex marriage.Indeed, the HMA perhaps implies, but nowhere explicitly specifies that marriage has to be between a man and a woman. The word â\\x80\\x98manâ\\x80\\x99 does not even appear in the entire text of the Act, and â\\x80\\x98womanâ\\x80\\x99 makes just one cameo. â\\x80\\x98Husbandâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98wifeâ\\x80\\x99 are used, but those could be interpreted today in the realm of roleplay.Appearing for the Union government, solicitor general Tushar Mehta reportedly told the court that â\\x80\\x9cour legal system, society and values do not recognise marriage between same-sex couplesâ\\x80\\x9d.Some may argue that Hindu marriage is predicated on â\\x80\\x98putrarthe kriyate bharyaâ\\x80\\x99 or procreation, but such ancient references are neither legally nor morally binding on any Hindu, especially in a civilisation which prides itself in being flexible, ever-changing and free-flowing like its great rivers.A knowledgeable man like Mehta surely also knows that Hindu culture is replete with same-sex imagery. These are celebrated, far from the shadow of the Abrahamic punishing-rod of sin and damnation.To participate in Krishnaâ\\x80\\x99s Vrindavan raas leela with Radha and the gopis, for instance, Shiva bathed in the Yamuna and took a womanâ\\x80\\x99s shape. Krishna recognised him and hailed him as Gopeshwar. Vrindavan still has a Gopeshwar temple, where Shiva is worshipped in his feminine form. The lingam is dressed up as a gopi, and shringar ceremonies are held. There are many such references across Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s ancient texts, including the Mahabharat and Ramayan.So, the solicitor generalâ\\x80\\x99s culture excuse does not hold. Besides, India society constantly adapts and reforms, and so do our laws.The question here is why should such marriages happen only under the Hindu Marriage Act? One of the first acts of prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru after Independence was to clean up Hindu personal law through the Hindu Code Bills, ushering modernity in marriage, succession and other laws. However, he left Muslim personal law untouched.Why should another set of changes be carried out for just Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains leaving out other Indians? Why canâ\\x80\\x99t the Special Marriage Act of 1954, which applies to people from all faiths, be amended to allow same-sex marriage?Better still, we should soon get a progressive Uniform Civil Code under which LGBTQIA civil unions are solemnised. And before we rush into legalising gay marriage, nuanced issues like child adoptions should be wisely, meticulously debated and thrashed out.It seems plain unjust that same-sex couples should be denied normal rights that married heterosexual partners have â\\x80\\x94simple things like legally consenting to medical procedures, a joint property or insurance plan, or nomination formalities.The time to allow same-sex marriages or civil unions has come.

       " 'The Lok Sabha faced an impasse on Friday with the House being adjourned four times during the discussion on the Centre\\'s PM CARES fund, while the Rajya Sabha passed several bills in its session. Friday was the fifth day of the Parliament\\'s Monsoon Session.The proceedings in the Lower House were disrupted as the Opposition raised slogans against Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur for his allegation that the PM National Relief Fund (PMNRF) was set up \"only for the benefit of the Gandhi family\".\"The trust was set up during the tenure of former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and was not even registered as a public trust but it got all relevant clearance, including FCRA,\" Thakur said, intervening during the introduction of the Taxation and other Laws (Relaxation of Certain Provisions) Bill.\"The PM Cares Fund is a constitutionally set up public charitable trust. PM National Relief Fund was set up only for the benefits of one family â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0 the Nehru-Gandhi family,\" he said.However, after a string of adjournments due to Opposition MPs demanding an apology from the Union minister, Speaker Om Birla urged him to reflect on his comments. Subsequently, Thakur said, \"I had no intention of hurting anyone but if someone has been hurt, I express my anguish.\"Meanwhile, the Rajya Sabha passed theÂ\\xa0Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020; Salaries and Allowances of Ministers (Amendment) Bill, 2020; Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020; and Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill, 2020, reports said.The Lok Sabha also passed the Demand for Supplementary Grants for additional spending of Rs 2.35 lakh crore in 2020-21 by a voice vote.Supplementary grants are sought from the exchequer when the authorised grants for government expenditure fall short due to any reason. The government said that the unforeseen expenditures in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated the need for supplementary grants this year.Ruckus in Lok Sabha amid discussion on PM CARES fundThe ruckusÂ\\xa0in the Lok Sabha began during the procedure for the introduction of the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020.After speaking during the procedure for introduction of the bill, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that her deputy, MoS Thakur, will talk about PM CARES Fund.Opposition members raised concerns about the fund and during his speech, Thakur targetted the Congress and the Gandhi family. He also alleged that the Congress had misused the PM National Relief Fund.Thakur alleged that the PMNRF has not been registered till now and also stressed that alleged misuse of funds needs to be looked into.When Congress members protested, Thakur said that \"names of Nehru and Gandhi family should be taken\" and alleged that the Gandhi family had \"ruined the country\".In protest against the minister\\'s remarks about the Gandhis, Congress members walked out of the House.Amid the din, the Speaker first adjourned the proceedings for 30 minutes till 4.20 pm.After the House reconvened at 4.20 pm, Sitharaman introduced the bill and then the House took up the discussion onÂ\\xa0\\'Supplementary Demands for Grants 2020-21\\'.However, Congress MPs demanded an apology from Thakur for his remarks against the Gandhis.When Rama Devi, who was presiding over the proceedings, asked Chowdhury to speak on supplementary demands for excess grants, he said first the House has to be brought in order and then criticised Thakur for his remarks.Then, Rama Devi asked BJP member Jayant Sinha to speak on supplementary demands. However, whileÂ\\xa0he was speaking, Congress members raised slogans such as \\'Anurag Thakur maafi maango\\'Â\\xa0and some Congress MPs entered the Well of the House while raising slogans.The House was then adjourned thrice till 6 pm.Birla was in the Chair when the House recovened at 6 pm.Â\\xa0Before the discussion on supplementary grants resumed, he praised members for their extraordinary efforts during this difficult time.Birla added, \"If anyone thinks that the Chair has hurt someone, I would like to say that it may be unintentional. For me every member is equal and protecting every member is my duty.\"\"If I say anything to anyone, the intention is not to hurt anyone but to run this House smoothly. If someone has been hurt in that process, I personally seek apology from him or her,\" he also said.Opposition slams Centre over economy, GST compensation issueAs the discussion on Supplementary Demands for Grants 2020-21 got underway, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said that Indian economy \"was in the doldrums even before the COVID-19 crisis and the government\\'s response following the pandemic has only made the situation worse\".Chowdhury, leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, said the stimulus package announced to help the nation tide over the crisis was a \"pitiful 1.7 percent of GDP\".\"Despite our plea, the Centre did not take corrective measures (for the economy). It refused to accept that demonetisation was a huge blunder, it refused to accept our advice for a simple GST,\" he said.\"The Modi government\\'s response to the pandemic-affected economy made the situation worse,\" he asserted. Chowdhury alleged that the government made a false claim that it has provided 10 percent of GDP as fiscal stimulus.\"It was big lie. The stimulus imparted by the Modi government was a pitiful 1.7 percent of GDP,\" he said.Meanwhile, TMC, DMK, BSP, RSP, among other Opposition parties also criticised the Centre over the economy and GST.DMK\\'s Dayanidhi Maran also objected to the use of expression \\'Act of God\\' by Sitharaman on the issue revenue loss of the state governments.\"Demonetisation was a man-made pandemic, and then GST was hurriedly introduced. How can the Centre expect the states to go for additional borrowing? The Centre is accountable for providing GST compensation to the states.\"The Central government\\'s policy and financial response to the COVID crisis has been lukewarm; the economy has collapsed under the weight of the pandemic. It has not undertaken any economic reforms in the last six years,\" he was quoted as saying by The Hindu. He also demanded a white paper on the economic crisis.Opposition MPs also slammed the Centre for its statement that there was no data on the deaths of migrants after the COVID-19-induced lockdown.FM Sitharaman, responding to MPs\\' arguments in the extended session of the Lower House, said that additional grants being sought by the Centre are \"largely\" being directed for \"people-centric activity\" and schemes like PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana.She added that the Centre\\'s total allocation for the MGNREGA scheme is now almost at Rs 1 lakh crore, \"which is the highest amount ever spent\" on the scheme.She also said that the total transfer of funds to the state governments, which is the combination of amounts as tax and grants, is 19Â\\xa0percent more than last year.She was quoted by The Hindu as saying, \"The total transfer to states exceeds centre\\'s gross tax revenue â\\x80\\x94 it is at 107Â\\xa0percent. 61Â\\xa0percent of grants put in the budget provisions has already been given. There is a frontload.\"Rajya Sabha passes bill to cut MPs\\' salaries by 30%The Rajya Sabha on Friday passed a bill to reduce salaries of MPs by 30 percent for one year to augment financial resources required to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, with Opposition MPs supporting the move but demanding the restoration of the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS).Rajya Sabha passed the bill on Friday, while Lok Sabha had cleared it on Tuesday.Opposition members in both the House supported the move, but pressed for restoration of MPLADS fund, which has been suspended for two years. They also said public money should not be spent under such circumstances on projects, including a new Parliament building and a bullet train.An MP draws a salary of Rs one lakh per month and a constituency allowance of Rs 70,000 per month, besides other allowances.The Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill, 2020 will replace a similar ordinance issued in April this year. The consolidated amount of MPLADS funds for two years â\\x80\\x94 Rs 7,900 crore â\\x80\\x94 will go to the Consolidated Fund of India.While supporting the cuts in salaries, most Opposition members who participated in the discussion in Rajya Sabha urged the government to review its decision to suspend the MPLADS fund for two years, saying it was necessary to carry out development works in their respective constituencies.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said this was a temporary suspension.During the debate, Joshi said it did not matter how much money was being saved through salary cuts of members. \"Charity should begin at home and that is the concept we have started. It is not Rs 4 crore saving as said by DMK member but Rs 53.9 crore per year from members\\' salary,\" he said.On several Opposition members asking the government to stop various projects like the bullet train and construction of a new Parliament building to cut costs, Joshi said, \"First you say public spending should be increased and now you are demanding that all these projects should be stopped.Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy, who moved the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers (Amendment) Bill, said COVID-19 has impacted the incomes of people working in the private sector and so the prime minister initiated this bill which entails 30 percent reduction in ministers\\' salaries.Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said around 70 percent MPs depend on their salaries and have to take care of every expense through these emoluments alone.He said MPLADS funds are meant for taking care of needy people in their constituencies and are utilised for various things like purchasing ambulances and building small roads and community centres.\"It (MPLADS) should not be suspended for two years. How did you presume that corona will go on for two years? Even if you had to do it you should have reduced it by half to Rs 2.5 crore (each MP). My suggestion to the government will be to reduce it for one year and in that one year Rs 2.5 crore fund be kept,\" he said.Similarly, Vishambhar Prasad Nishad (SP), V Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP), K Somaprasad (CPM), Fauzia Khan (NCP), Veer Singh (BSP) and Nazir Ahmad Laway (PDP), while supporting the reduction in salaries, sought restoration of the MPLAD scheme.Wilson said the Centre is suspending MPLAD scheme when various infrastructure projects like Central Vista project were still being taken up.The Rajya Sabha also approved bills replacing ordinances related to the Central Council of Homoeopathy and the Indian Medicine Central Council on Friday.The Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 seeks to further extend the time to form the Central Council of Homeopathy by a year, after exhausting two years for the purpose.The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 seeks a year\\'s time to reconstitute the central council and provides for a board of directors to exercise its powers in the interim period.Replying to a debate on the two bills, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the government is committed to providing affordable and easy healthcare facilities to every citizen.He also defended the Centre\\'s decision to bring ordinances, saying there was nothing \"abnormal\" and that governments have been taking this route, depending on the necessity.With inputs from agencies',\n",

       " 'New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday questioned Sudarshan TV over its \\'Bindas Bol\\' programme, whose promo had claimed that the channel would show the \"big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service\", and asked whether media can be allowed to target a whole set of communities.The apex court, which has already imposed a pre-telecast ban on episodes of \\'UPSC Jihad\\' programmes on a plea raising grievance over the show, took strong note of alleged inaction of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the National Broadcasting Association (NBA).The top court sought suggestions from the Centre and the NBA for strengthening the self-regulating mechanism for electronic media.A bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud, in a hearing conducted through video conferencing, recalled the days of Emergency and said it did not want to act like the censor board but the issue was whether the media can be allowed to target and brand the entire community and alienate them by doing such kind of stories.\"You have to tell us voluntarily what you will do to assuage our concerns. We don\\'t want to come in the way of journalism. We know as a Court what happened during Emergency, so we will ensure free speech and ideas,\" said the bench, also comprising Justices KM Joseph and Indu Malhotra.The top court asked Suresh Chavhanke, editor-in-chief of the channel, to file an affidavit by Monday expressing his bonafide and voluntary decision on not using certain things in the programme.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the channel, defended the programme and sought vacation of the stay on its telecast saying it was not against the entry of members of the Muslim community.He said the programme brought the fact to public notice that \\'Zakat Foundation\\' has received funds from various terror-linked organizations.Zakat Foundation provides training and study materials largely to Muslim students who aspire to join civil services.The contents of the four episodes which have been telecast by now, came under scrutiny of the court which flagged many aspects, saying all investigating journalism was permissible but maligning of entire community cannot be allowed.\"This is the real issue. Whenever you show them joining civil services, you show ISIS. You want to say that Muslims joining civil services is a part of a deep-rooted conspiracy. Can the media be allowed to target a whole set of communities,\" it said.Painting all candidates as carrying out an agenda shows a kind of hatred. This is the element of concern, said the bench.\"Here free speech becomes hatred. You can\\'t brand every member of the community. You alienate the good members too by divisive agenda,\" it said.The bench told Divan that the court has no problem with the story on investigative journalism on funding from terror linked organizations but it cannot be said that Muslims are carrying out some agenda by going for UPSC services.\"Let a message go to the media that a particular community cannot be targeted. We have to look after a nation of the future which is cohesive and diverse,\" it said, adding, \"Let this message go to the media that the country cannot survive with such agenda.\"Divan said the channel has no problem with any individual from any community joining the civil services on merit.\"Channel wants to complete the broadcast. We are not running away anywhere. As far as the four episodes are seen as whole then a cuss word here and there should not ignite the jurisdiction of this court to impose a pre-telecast ban,\" he said.However, the bench said, \"Look at the tenor of the statements. Audience says all things which have been elicited by the show. We have no issue with the NGO or sources of funding. Their issue is you implicate a whole community as taking over the civil services.\"Some of the pictorials are hurtful to us such as green t-shirts and skull caps,\" the bench said, adding, \"We are not the censor board.\"The bench observed that some of the offensive contents should be taken off.Divan told the bench that the channel would file an affidavit with regard to the alleged offensive content of the programme as pointed out by the court.The bench observed, \"We know how an injunction order will be looked like. I am afraid that there will be injunctions galore and we don\\'t want that to be the law of land. We want to give your client a good faith option.\"The bench also asked Zakat Foundation, an NGO which provides training to largely Muslims students aspiring for civil services, whether it wanted to intervene in the case following allegations of foreign funding from some terror linked organizations to its Indian set up.The bench told senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for Zakat Foundation, that the affidavit of Sudarshan TV has allegations of foreign funding against his client.Hegde said his client is a charitable organization and has been supporting non-Muslims as well and this kind of social service is not known even in government circles.The channel has also filed an application in the apex court seeking live telecast of the hearing in the matter.On 15 September, the top court had restrained the channel from telecasting the episodes of \"Bindas Bol\" programme till further orders, saying that \"the intent\" of the episodes \"prima facie\" appeared to \"vilify\" the Muslim community.',\n",

       " 'Lok Sabha, passed the controversial Farmers\\' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill on Thursday, following which a minister from Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), one of BJP\\'s oldest ally, quit the Cabinet as mark of her protest.The Bills, which were promulgated as ordinances on 5 June, seek to pave the way for entry of private players in agriculture and promote hurdle-free sale of produce, which until now were regulated by various laws capping stockpiling, procurement and storageÂ\\xa0to ensure food security. However, protesting farmers argue that the new bill will bring about corporate dominance in the agro sector.Various opposition parties also opposed the legislation arguing that the much touted reform will pave the way for privatisation of agricultural sector. Despite being an NDA ally, SAD too vehemently opposed the legislation leading to thee dramatic resignation ofÂ\\xa0Food Processing Industries Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal announced at the floor of Lok Sabha by her husband and party president Sukhbir Singh Badal.The Bills were passed two days after the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was passed by the Lok Sabha. The proposed legislation seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities, ending the imposition of stock-holding limits except under extraordinary circumstances.After the passage of the Bills, Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said farmers will now have freedom for direct marketing of their produce and will be able to get better prices. The minister, however, clarified that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement system will continue to remain in place.Farmers\\' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020The Bill seeks to provide for the creation of an ecosystem where the farmers and traders enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale and purchase of farmers\\' produce, as against an older system where the farmers were allowed to sell their produce to only a few licensed traders at their nearest agricultural produce market committeeÂ\\xa0bazaar.The bill, by removing these limitations, envisions an environment where remunerative prices for agricultural goods can be facilitated through competitive alternative trading channels.Under the Billâ\\x80\\x99s provisions, farmers will not be charged any cess or levy for sale of their produce under this Act. They can straight up trade their goods to a private player. Furthermore, there will be a separate dispute resolution mechanism for the farmers. The bill also has provisions to help farmers of regions with surplus produce to get better prices for their produce, according to PIB.Â\\xa0Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020The Bill seeks to provide for a national framework on farming agreements that protects and empowers farmers to engage with agri-business firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for farm services and sale of future farming produce at a mutually agreed remunerative price framework in a fair and transparent manner.The bill is intended to shift the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor and also enable the farmer to access modern technology and better inputs. It will reduce cost of marketing and improve income of farmers. The proposed legislation will act as a catalyst to attract private sector investment for building supply chains for supply of Indian farm produce to national and global markets.Sale, lease or mortgage of farmersâ\\x80\\x99 land is totally prohibited and farmersâ\\x80\\x99 land is also protected against any recovery under the Bill.Treasury, Opposition Benches clash over BillsMoving the two Bills for passage in the House, Tomar said that the two bills aim to make farmers prosperous and legislations will not impact the provisions of minimum support price (MSP).He said the bill does not encroach on the rights of state Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC)s and inter-state trade can take place. Tomar said the states impose levies to the tune of 2 to 8.5 percent as mandi tax, but under the new regime farmers need not pay these taxes if they choose to sell their produce outside the APMC framework.\"These two bills make farming profitable and prosperous and will also give freedom to farmers. Farmers will have the right to sell their produce to anyone. There will be no tax of state government or central government on trade outside mandis. Now only 50-60 people do trade in mandis and competition exists among themselves,\" the minister said.Tomar said that these bills will be able to meet the requirements of farming in the future and lead to more investment in agriculture.Meanwhile, the Opposition slammed the Centre for stepping in statesâ\\x80\\x99 domain, also claiming that the bill will corporatise farming to benefit the traders. \"There is a sinister attempt by the Centre to legislate on subjects under the state list,\" said Mahua Moitra, Trinamool MP.Opposition MPs said the Bills would take away the safety nets provided by the state regulations through the APMC Act, while also eroding the revenue sources of the states. Congressâ\\x80\\x99 Jasbir Singh Gill said large traders and corporate will destroy the small farmers.Congress deputy leader in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi said, \"This Government has been eying, how they can take the farmersâ\\x80\\x99 land to benefit their capitalist friends, whether in the Land Acquisition Act, whether in the industrial system through the weakening the labour courts and now this three pronged attack.\"Trinamool Congressâ\\x80\\x99s Kalyan Banerjee said any agreement under the new law would be between two unequal parties as farmers would have unequal bargaining powers.The Congress said the farm sector legislations brought in by the government defeat the purpose of the Green Revolution and will be \"a death knell for the future of farming\". Congress MPs staged a protest in front of Mahatma Gandhi\\'s statue in the Parliament cmplex, while Gill, Ravneet Singh Bittu, Gurjit Singh Aujla and Amar Singh burnt copies of the Bills.Farmers stage protest against BillsFarmers blocked major highways in parts of Punjab and Haryana on 16 September to demand that the proposed laws should not be pursued in Parliament. Protesting farmers opine the Centreâ\\x80\\x99s repeated assurances that the MSP will continue is deceptive and fear that the Centre will end the current system of open-ended Food Corporation of India procurement, leaving them at the mercy of traders\\' predatory practices.Over 250 farmer and farm-worker organisations, under the umbrella of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), have given a call for a Bharat bandh on 25 September.Farmers in Punjab have organised a three-day protest against the Bills. They will stage a â\\x80\\x98rail rokoâ\\x80\\x99 agitation across the state from 24-26 September, a farmersâ\\x80\\x99 body said. Despite reassurances from the government, farmers believe that the bills will render the current MSP procurement system ineffective, leaving them at the mercy of â\\x80\\x9cbig farmersâ\\x80\\x9d.In Haryana, as many as 17 farmer outfits that have joined hands under the flag of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Chaduni) and announced continuation of their protest across the State. â\\x80\\x9cOn September 20, we will block all major roads between 12 noon and 3 pmin protest against the Bills. We will also support the â\\x80\\x98Bharat bandhâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d Rakesh Bains of the BKU, said, according to The Hindu.Farmers want MSPs to be at least 50 percent over their weighted average cost of production and non-payment of MSPs to be recognised a punishable offence. â\\x80\\x9cOnce sales move out, they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be recorded as APMC sales and there would be no benchmark,â\\x80\\x9d agricultural activist Kiran Kumar Vissa said, according to a Down To Earth report.With inputs from PTI',\n",
       " 'With threat of eviction looming close, slum dwellers squatting on railways land in New Delhi, on Friday launched a stir demanding resettlement and/or upgradation offer from the government at their own terms.The Railway Basti Jan Sangharsh Morcha, a coalition of slum residents and activists working for the rights of those living in temporary hutments along railway tracks in New Delhi, noted that even though the court had said that there will be no forced eviction immediately, it demanded that the government should provideÂ\\xa0in-situ upgradation rather than resettling them away from their homes.The protests come in the wake of a 31 August Supreme Court order in which the apex court hadÂ\\xa0directed removal of 48,000 slum dwellings along 140 kilometres of railway tracks in Delhi within three months in a phased manner.The top court had also restrained any court from granting any kind of stay with respect to removal of encroachments in the area, adding that there shall not be any kind of political interference in execution of the plan.\"The encroachments which are there in safety zones should be removed within a period of three months and no interference, political or otherwise, should be there and no Court shall grant any stay with respect to removal of the encroachments in the area in question,\" the court had said.Following this, Congress leader Ajay Maken and several residents from these clusters urgently approached the court for relief against the demolition order, The HinduÂ\\xa0reported.â\\x80\\x9cSlum dwellers have a fundamental right to the city. They are an integral part of the social and economic fabric of the town... If the demolition of slums is carried out amidst the current pandemic, more than 2,50,000 persons will be forced to move around the city in search for shelter and livelihood,â\\x80\\x9d Maken said in his submission to the court, according to the newspaper.As per rough estimates, there are around 2,40,000 people living in slums in Naraina Vihar, Azadpur, Vihar, Shakur Basti, Mayapuri, Sriniwaspuri, Anand Parbat and Okhla among others.The Central Government, in response to Maken\\'s plea, clarified on Monday that it had no immediate plans to uproot over 2 lakh families in the middle of the pandemic, adding thatÂ\\xa0discussions were underway between the Union Ministry of Urban Housing Development, the Railways and the Government of NCT of Delhi to implement the top court\\'s order,Â\\xa0Hindustan Times reported.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also assured the slum residents that no sudden coercive action will be taken against them and that their representatives will be invited to be a part of the consultations deciding the fate of the slum residents.The Delhi government also clarified that any resettlement of rehabilitation will have to be done as per theÂ\\xa0Delhi Slum and JJ Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015.According to the said policy, residents of jhuggi jhopri clustersÂ\\xa0which have come up before 01 January 2006 shall not be removed without rehabilitation. Furthermore, the policy favours in-situ rehabilitation â\\x80\\x94 which provides for alternative accomodation in the same place as the slum cluster.The residents association welcomed the statements made by the Central and state governments, but decided to go ahead with the protest to seek a lasting solution to the problem.Among other things, the residents have demadned to be consulted during the planning, the rehabilitation plan prioritisesÂ\\xa0in-situ upgradation, and thatÂ\\xa0resettlement should be treated only as a last resort.The slum dwellers feel that the timing of the Supreme Court order was particularly harsh as the poor had been already reeling under the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown.Forty-eight-year-old Veeramma, who works as a domestic help in the nearby domestic clusters, says that the pandemic took away her entire family\\'s livelihood and now the court\\'s order could mean that she may also become homeless.\"My husband cannot move. My son is a daily wager, he doesn\\'t have much work, too. We don\\'t have enough ration to feed the family for another week,\" said Veeramma looking at her two-year-old granddaughter, a third generation to be born in the slum cluster.\"We don\\'t have the money for my granddaughterâ\\x80\\x99s milk. Even if we beg, we wonâ\\x80\\x99t get anything. The times were never so bad,\" she told PTI.Elumalai, 35, reminded the government\\'\\'s promise of \"jahan jhuggi wahin makan\" made before the elections.\"We do not say we won\\'t accept the court\\'\\'s order. This land belongs to the railways and they will take it one day, but where will we go? No one cares for us,\" Elumalai, whose father came to Delhi from Chennai in 1978, told PTI.Interestingly, each household in the slum has got electricity connection, Aadhaar card, voter id, and ration card, the news agency reported.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had built community toilets for the slum dwellers last year, so that no one defecates in the open or on the tracks, Shankar Sarangam, a driver told PTI.\"The salary has been reduced by half. I have a family to feed. We were thankful to god that we have a roof over our head. Now the jhuggi will be gone, too. The railways should have at least considered the timing of the move. The impact of the pandemic will linger on for another three years,\" Sarangam added.With inputs from PTI',\n",

       " 'The Lok Sabha passed the Farmersâ\\x80\\x99 Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 on Thursday. It had already approved the vital amendment to the Essential Commodities Act earlier in the ongoing session.These decisions will offer farmers the freedom to sell their produce beyond the restrictions of the â\\x80\\x98mandisâ\\x80\\x99 of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). It permits them to indulge into contract farming with a legal support framework and opens up a wider market for their products by removing the barriers of inter-state trading.Entrepreneurs will not have to abide by a stringent stock limit for commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes. With the new bill, they will be able to take advantage of cold storage facilities and prevent the wastage of excess produce of the farmers caused by a fruitful harvest season.Free trade, effective and mutually beneficial collaboration with larger businesses and elimination of hindrances on mass purchase and storage of vital products are instrumental in unshackling the massive underlying potential in the farm industry.Only political powers that harness vested interests in middlemen can possibly develop an opposition to these bills. Or, as in the case of the Indian National Congress (INC), spread a misinformation campaign on the three farm bills in question. Apparently, talks are doing the rounds that farmers will be deprived of a minimum support price (MSP) for their products through these acts.Firstly, it has been clarified by key stakeholders in the government that the MSP will continue to exist parallel to these reforms. Secondly, the defanging of APMC is in fact an attempt to ensure that farmers manage to gain a greater value for their produce than these support prices that are arbitrarily fixated by mandiÂ\\xa0agents according to their whims and fancies.By engaging directly with prospective buyers, the agriculturists will now be able to evade paying massive commissions at APMCs to sell their produce. The market intermediaries had been making hefty profits over the years because of the huge cost difference between the price paid to farmers and the cost at which the final produce is sold to consumers.Moreover, the creeping demand for an â\\x80\\x98MSPâ\\x80\\x99 to exist is because of the vast insecurity of agriculture not being a profitable, professional industry that adequately rewards its growers. Hence, the farmers crave for the assurance of a minimum fee for their produce; regardless of the fact that the market price of that commodity could multiply extensively if a larger base of customers is available to them.Unsurprisingly, forces that so far have benefitted by constraining the growers into a dogma are baffled by these long-due measures. MandisÂ\\xa0had become a breeding ground for unceremonious political powers at local levels.Local politicians derived revenue through the commissions gained by the agents in these places. Hence, Harsimrat Kaur Badalâ\\x80\\x99s resignation from the union cabinet in opposition of these bills glaringly indicates the possibly illicit profits that regional parties acquired from the mandis. Pressure is being mounted on Jannayak Janata Party chief Dushyant Chautala to oppose this decision in Haryana, thus pushing the Manohar Lal Khattar-government on the edge.As for the Congress, having mentioned their intent to take these steps in their manifesto before the general elections in 2019, the party is just solidifying its intellectual dishonesty and petty opportunism at the expense of farmers of this country.',\n",

A similar incident had happened with a passenger on one of the airline\\'s other Dubai flights previously,\" said one of the officials.Therefore, the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) has suspended Air India Express flights from 18 September to 2 October, the officials stated.Both the incidents of passengers flying with COVID-19 positive certificates to Dubai from India on Air India Express flights happened during the last couple of weeks, the officials noted.In a statement later during the day, Air India Express confirmed it had received a \"notice of suspension\" from the DCAA on 17 September to suspend its Dubai flights from 18 September to 2 October.\"The notice has been issued on account of erroneous acceptance of one COVID positive passenger by the airline\\'s ground handling agents at Delhi and Jaipur on Air India Express flights to Dubai on 28th Aug and 4th Sept, respectively,\" the airline noted.It said the ground handling agencies have taken appropriate punitive action against their employees who have been held accountable for the lapses at Delhi and Jaipur.Air India Express\\' ground handling in India is done by Air India Air Transport Services Limited (AIATSL), which is a subsidiary of the national carrier Air India. Air India Express is also a subsidiary of Air India.\"As per information gathered, passengers who were seated in close proximity to the COVID positive passenger on each flight had undergone COVID test/quarantined as determined by the Dubai Health authority,\" Air India Express said in its statement.The airline stated it has again told its \"handling agencies in India\" to strictly adhere to the regulations when it comes to \"acceptance\" of passengers on flights.As an \"abundant precaution\", the carrier said it has advised its handling agents to implement a \"three-tier checking mechanism\" to avoid any such lapse in future.The airline said it has introduced additional flights to Sharjah to accommodate the passengers affected by the suspension of its Dubai flights.\"The affected passengers who have booked to fly to Dubai are also being given the option to rebook to a future date,\" the carrier mentioned.Scheduled international flights have been suspended in India since 23 March due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown.However, special international passenger flights have been operating in India under Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral airÂ\\xa0 bubble arrangements formed between India and other countries since July.The United Arab Emirates is one of the 10 countries with which India has established a bilateral air bubble pact. In such a pact, airlines of both the countries can operate international passenger flights with certain restrictions.',\n",
       " 'In the ongoing investigations into the Bengaluru drug racket case in which Aditya Alva, son of late politician Jeevaraj Alva was named, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) officials have intensified their search at his farmhouse in Hebbal.Aditya, one of the prime accused in the case, along with Shivaprakash Chappi, who works with the transport department, is still absconding after 13 days of the FIR being registered.So far 12 people have been arrested, including actors Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjanaa Galrani, who are currently in judicial custody.Joint commissioner of police (crime) Sandeep Patil told Times of India they are making best efforts to trace Alva and the others.Asked about the delayed raid on Aditya\\'s house, Patil said: \"Search warrant is given by courts on evidence and materials placed by the investigating officer. We submitted the evidence collected so far in court and obtained the warrant. In the raid, narcotics have been found.\"In a statement, the CCB said, \"search warrant obtained and searches being conducted at Aditya\\'s farmhouse near Hebbal called \\'House of Life\\'.\"The police team stormed into his grand house situated on the banks of Nagwara lake in Hebbal and searched the premises. The bungalow is spread over four acres and is used by Alva to organise parties, where drugs were allegedly supplied.Those arrested in the case include film actresses Ragini Dwivedi, Sanjjanaa Galrani, party organiser Viren Khanna, realtor Rahul Tonse and an RTO clerk BK Ravishankar.The CCB took up the matter after the Narcotics Control Bureau arrested three people, including a woman with a huge cache of synthetic drugs, who was allegedly supplying them to the Kannada film actors and actresses.Another report claimed that Ravishankar had informed the police that most of the drug parties were held at Aditya\\'s farmhouse. He had also confessed to the use and consumption of drugs in these parties. According to Ravishankar, it is the same farmhouse where ecstasy pills were consumed.On Thursday, a video had gone viral, which led to allegations that one of the actors arrested in the case was involved in honey-trapping. A senior officer said that the video is yet to be verified, Bangalore Mirror reported.CCB sleuths on Thursday arrested three more drug peddlers and recovered 90 kg of marijuana worth Rs 50 lakh, the report further said.The accused have been identified as Azam Pasha (25) owner of the flat in Doddabanahalli where the marijuana was found, along with two of his associates: Masthan Vali (25) and Mohammed Abbas (27). All three have been arrested.Police said that the accused would purchase marijuana from their contact Praveen from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and smuggle it to the city concealed in a goods vehicle. They would then store it at the flat and sell it to other peddlers in the city.In the crackdown against drug peddlers in the state, many more actors and musicians, are under the police scanner for their alleged links to the massive drug racket.The CCB sleuths on Wednesday also grilled actors and couple Diganth Manchale and Aindrita Ray in connection with the alleged drug trafficking case.CCB sources said that they allegedly found pictures of the couple attending parties that other accused persons Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjana Galrani had also attended.They further said that the couple would be questioned about their links to other accused in the case, including Viren Khanna, Aditya, Rahul Tonse and Ravishankar.\"There was a video of Aindrita Ray promoting a party that went viral in some party groups. We want to question the couple based on that and also regarding the information provided by other accused persons,\" the CCB source said.All the accused have been booked them under Sections 21, 21C, 27A, 27B, and 29B of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.',\n",

       " 'The chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police Special Cell is more communally grotesque than the tsunami of hatred that swept North East Delhi this February. All the 15 people, charged under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Indian Penal Code and Arms Act, are connected to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) demonstrations. The police havenâ\\x80\\x99t charged a single CAA supporter or hate-monger.The most jarringly missing name in the 17,000-page charge sheet is that of Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Kapil Mishra, the â\\x80\\x98instigator-in-chiefâ\\x80\\x99 in the riots. Mishraâ\\x80\\x99s belligerently provocative speech against CAA protesters on 23 February at Maujpur â\\x80\\x94 less than a kilometre from the Jafrabad Metro Station, where more than a hundred women were peacefully protesting the controversial law â\\x80\\x94 has been repeatedly cited in reports and court petitions as the main reason that triggered the riots.With deputy commissioner of police, North East, Ved Prakash Surya beside him in riot gear, Mishra had the gall to threaten CAA protesters with direct confrontation and issue an ultimatum to the police if Jafrabad and Chand Bagh werenâ\\x80\\x99t cleared in three days. â\\x80\\x9cTill the time [US President] Trump goes back [from India], we are going to go forward peacefully. But after that, we will not listen to the police if roads are not cleared. After that, we will have to come on the roads,â\\x80\\x9d he thundered.The indisputable fact that rioters stormed several parts of North East Delhi â\\x80\\x94 including Shiv Vihar, Khajuri Khas, Chand Bagh, Gokulpuri, Maujpur, Karawal Nagar and Jafrabad â\\x80\\x94 hours after Mishraâ\\x80\\x99s provocative speech has been mentioned in the Report of the Delhi Minorities Commission Fact-finding Committee on North-East Delhi Riots of February 2020.In fact, the highly charged atmosphere of CAA and National Register of Citizens demonstrations had started turning ominous few weeks before the riots with Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur and BJP MP Parvesh Verma making dangerous communally laced remarksâ\\x80\\x94with the police as a mute spectator.Thakurâ\\x80\\x99s infamous slogan at an election rally in Delhi, on 20 January, â\\x80\\x9cDesh ke ghaddaron ko (the traitors of the country)â\\x80\\x9d, which instigated the vociferously charged-up crowd to complete its second half â\\x80\\x9cGoli maaron saalon koÂ\\xa0(shoot the traitors)â\\x80\\x9d, was indirectly directed towards a particular community and the protesters.On 28 January, Verma presented a dangerous consequence of the protests in a TV interview comparing the demonstrations to the height of Kashmir terrorism in the â\\x80\\x9890s. â\\x80\\x9cThe people of Delhi know that the fire that raged in Kashmir a few years ago, where the daughters and sisters of Kashmiri Pandits were raped â\\x80¦ This fire can reach the residences of Delhi anytime â\\x80¦ Lakhs of people [protesters] gather there. These people will enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters and kill them.â\\x80\\x9dThe policeâ\\x80\\x99s blatant bias towards such hate-mongers was palpable from the very beginning when no First Information Reports (FIRs) were registered against them despite a Delhi High Court order. As dead bodies piled up and violence and looting escalated, the court, hearing a petition that sought registration of an FIR against Mishra, Thakur and Verma for their remarks that allegedly instigated the rioters, asked police to take a â\\x80\\x9cconscious decisionâ\\x80\\x9d to register such an FIR in 24 hours.In reply to similar petitions filed in the high court, the police said in July that no â\\x80\\x9cactionable evidenceâ\\x80\\x9d was found against the trio and AAPâ\\x80\\x99s Amanatullah Khan. In an affidavit filed before the court, the police said that the violence appeared to â\\x80\\x9cbe a part of a well-thought-out conspiracy to destabilise harmony in societyâ\\x80\\x9d.Despite the fact-finding committee clearly stating that the riots were preceded by several such hate remarks, the police inaction shows its callousness to the riot victims. â\\x80\\x9cThe violence, which broke out in North East Delhi, was clearly preceded by a number of speeches by BJP leaders openly maligning anti-CAA protestors and questioning their motives with no basis, making derogatory remarks laden with communal undertones and open threats of violence,â\\x80\\x9d the report states.Hate speech in any form is barred in India. Though the Constitution allows freedom of speech and expression, it imposes reasonable restrictions to ensure public order, decency or morality. Article 19, clause (1), sub-clause (a) guarantees freedom of speech and expression, but clause (2) clearly states that â\\x80\\x9cnothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent the State from making any law, in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States,Â\\xa0public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offenceâ\\x80\\x9d.Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) prescribes imprisonment of up to three years or with fine or both for anyone who â\\x80\\x9c(a) by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, promotes or attempts to promote, on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community or any other ground whatsoever, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities or (b) commits any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities, and which disturbs or is likely to disturb the public tranquillityâ\\x80\\x9d.Similarly, Section 295A of the IPC says: â\\x80\\x9cWhoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of [citizens of India], [by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise], insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to [three years], or with fine, or with both.â\\x80\\x9dThat the remarks by Mishra, Thakur and Verma are in the category of hate speech, under relevant Article and sections of the Constitution, and the IPC, is irrefutable. Mishraâ\\x80\\x99s public threat in front of a senior police officer that he and his supporters â\\x80\\x9cwill not listen to the police if roads are not cleared [of CAA protesters]â\\x80\\x9d, which alluded to vigilantism, violates public order, decency and morality, mentioned in clause (2) of Article 19. The police should have immediately acted and arrested him on the spot.Similarly, Thakur egging on the crowd to chant â\\x80\\x9cDesh ke ghaddaron ko goli maaron saalon koâ\\x80\\x9dÂ\\xa0was a clear threat to public order and violated decency and morality. The police didnâ\\x80\\x99t act against him either.In August, the role of the police was severely criticised by Amnesty International India in a field investigation in which more than 50 riot survivors, eyewitnesses, lawyers, human rights activists and retired police officers were interviewed. Analysis of videos on social media â\\x80\\x9cAshowed Delhi police pelting stones with the rioters, torturing people, dismantling protest sites used by peaceful protesters and being mute bystanders as rioters wreaked havoc in Delhiâ\\x80\\x9d.According to the people interviewed by the human rights organisation, â\\x80\\x9cthe police did not respond to the multiple calls that were made to 100â\\x80\\x94policeâ\\x80\\x99s emergency helpline numberâ\\x80\\x94leaving the survivors to fend for themselves over the period of six days of violence in Delhiâ\\x80\\x9d.A break-up of the number of fatalities in the riots on the basis of religion shows that only 23 percent of the victims were Hindus. According to a Delhi Police affidavit in July, out of the 53 dead, 40 were Muslims. Contrast the break-up with the Delhi Policeâ\\x80\\x99s charge sheet, which states that â\\x80\\x9cthese conspirators were in direct touch with the foot soldiers that resulted in the riots in North East Delhi in February. Conspirators planned the riots while middle ring of leaders at the area level executed the plan through the foot soldiersâ\\x80\\x9d.Logically, if the all the conspirators were CAA protesters â\\x80\\x94 majority of whom were Muslims â\\x80\\x94 what did they achieve by killing members of their own community? If Hindus bore the brunt of the riots and more members of their community were killed compared to Muslims, the charge sheet would have held some semblance of logic.The chargesheet, which has clearly been prepared under political duress, has given a clean chit to the men whose incendiary speeches and remarks stoked the communal embers that engulfed North East Delhi.John Stuart Mill once said, â\\x80\\x9cBad men need nothing more to compass their ends than those good men should look on and do nothing.â\\x80\\x9d The police looked on and did nothing.The views expressed are personal.â\\x80\\x8b',\n",

       " 'â\\x80\\x9cWe were dragged out of our lands and thrown into buses,â\\x80\\x9d narrates Narsamma, a 45-year-old Koya Adivasi farmer from the Satyanarayanapuram village in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, Telangana. Hers is among 81 other Koya families from this village to be evicted from their agricultural lands in the last week of June. Satyanarayanapuram is a small village, home to the forest-dwelling Koyas, who have been cultivating lands here for over 22 years.These evictions are the result of a plantation drive called â\\x80\\x98Haritha Haramâ\\x80\\x99 by the Telangana government. The Telangana Ku Haritha Haram (which translates to A Green Garland for Telangana) scheme, as it is officially known, was launched on 3 July, 2015, by Chief Minister Kalvakuntla Chandrasekhar Rao to raise vegetation levels in the state from 24 percent to 33 percent.Ever since the beginning of this initiative, the resultant plantation drives have allegedly disturbed various Adivasi-inhabited regions.The last 11 days of June saw the residents of Satyanarayanapuram camping on their 200-acre agricultural lands, to prevent them from being seized. Their fate is just like lakhs of other forest-dwelling Adivasi communities in the country â\\x80\\x93 they donâ\\x80\\x99t have the necessary documents to prove ownership, and they have been fighting for decades to prove that they rightfully deserve land titles.***Legal entanglements and loopholesAccording to Section 4 (3) of The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 â\\x80\\x93 which is commonly referred to as the Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006 â\\x80\\x94 tribes and other traditional forest dwellers are entitled to up to four hectares of land, if the land was used as an occupational source and was being cultivated on or before 13 December 2005.This Act was an attempt to recognise forest-dwelling communities as a part of the ecosystem and to ensure their livelihood as the traditional residents of the land. Despite the Act granting lands by recognising dwellers, according to the data collected by the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs in 2017, 80,890 claims out of a total of 1,86,535 received by the government from across the country were rejected without providing valid reasons.The Koyas of Satyanarayanapuram have been trying to get documentation for their lands for many years, in vain. In 2002, cases were booked against a few villagers under Section 20 (1) (C) (ii), (iii), (iv), (vii) of the Andhra Pradesh Forest Act 1967, for illegal cultivation in Reserved Forest Areas. Ironically, it is the Preliminary Offence Report filed in this 2002 case that is the only existing proof the villagers can present, to state that they have been cultivating these lands before December 2005, thereby making them eligible for land titles under FRA 2006.On 25 June, 2020, CM Rao inaugurated Haritha Haramâ\\x80\\x99s sixth phase. â\\x80\\x9cWe cooked and slept in the forest for 11 days. Forest officials and the police would visit the land every day, asking us to evacuate. We refused to give in, and it eventually enraged them. We asserted that these lands had been used for cultivation for more than 20 years, but they rejected our plea since we did not possess the required documents,â\\x80\\x9d Narsamma says. Even after they presented the Preliminary Offence Report from 2002, the officials still went ahead and evicted them.Despite the Scheduled Area Land Transfer Regulation 1 of 1970, commonly known as 1/70, which prohibits the transfer of Adivasi land to non-tribals to safeguard forest-dwelling communities in Scheduled Areas, plantation drives have been conducted at a vast scale without giving intimation to gram sabhas.Sanjeev Gumpenapalli, a student of law and a Koya Adivasi hailing from the Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, says, â\\x80\\x9cThe State is considered to be a non-tribe. Acquiring land for anything in a Scheduled Area, including social forestry, without taking permission from the gram sabha is illegal. Acquiring means taking a position, so it indicates that these plantation drives are also a way of positioning themselves as controllers of the land.â\\x80\\x9dAccording to residents and local activists, gram sabhas are hardly ever informed about government intervention in these lands. â\\x80\\x9cMy permission was not sought before the officials entered the area. To my knowledge, the villagers have been practising podu cultivation there for over 20 years, but I do not wish to be involved in this conflict. Days after the officials started approaching the villagers to evict them, to plant saplings in their podu lands, they came to me asking me to coerce the tribals to move out, but I refused to do so,\" saysÂ\\xa0Srinu, the Sarpanch of Satyanarayanapuram.As reported by Telangana Today, the Minister of Forests and Environment of Telangana, Allola Indrakaran Reddy, announced at the launch of the sixth phase of Haritha Haram that 182 crore saplings have been planted since 2015, and that the Telangana government aims to plant 230 crore more across the state to reach its goal. \"Thousands of villages across the state have fallen prey to this scheme. The Forest Department has been conducting plantation drives exclusively in the areas where tribals have been cultivating for several generations,â\\x80\\x9d says activist Lingaswamy who hails from Bhadradri-Kothagudem.A response to an RTI filed by activist J Sudheer states that thus far, Rs. 4572.94 crore were spent on Haritha Haram from the time of its launch in 2015 to 4 September 2020. It received Rs 26.76 lakh as a donation. The RTI also revealed that 203 crore saplings were planted during the past five years, although there is no data on the number of saplings that have survived.Responding to the Writ Petition filed in 2008 by Wildlife First and several other prominent wildlife NGOs questioning the constitutional validity of FRA 2006, the Supreme Court passed an order on 13 February, 2019, directing states to evict up to two million forest dwellers, whose claims had been rejected. On 28 February 2019, the bench deferred the eviction order and instead demanded a review on the process of the implementation of the Act and if the state governments duly followed procedures before rejecting pleas for land titles.Uke Ramakrishna Dora, State President of the Adivasi Rachiyetala Sangham, says that â\\x80\\x9cbetween 2002 to 2004, up to three lakh tribals were evicted from their lands in the name of development and conservation. Regardless of the FRA being passed, not much has changed. Scheme after scheme falls into place to drive the traditional forest-dwelling communities away from their lands.â\\x80\\x9d***Growing dissentSeveral clashes between the tribals and the Forest Department have been reported since the implementation of Haritha Haram. â\\x80\\x9cThe officers visited us for 11 days and then turned up with a large troop. It seemed like they were everywhere in the forest, their jeeps and vans surrounded us. We were told that they were charging 20 of us with cases, and we were pushed into their vehicles. Our lands have been targeted before, but this was the first time we were being physically attacked,â\\x80\\x9d Narsamma says, in distress.â\\x80\\x9cIt was chaos. Children were crying and watching their mothers being pushed away into vehicles. We sat there for 11 days with barely any belongings, with the real threat of being bitten by insects and snakes. We had spent the last few months ploughing the land and sowing jowar, red gram and corn seeds, which had begun to sprout. They came and destroyed all that,â\\x80\\x9d she alleges.Koya Farmers in the Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, indicating how only a few saplings from the plantation drive have managed to survive.The villagers and activists say that three members of the community had been severely injured, and some of the elderly had to be rushed to the hospital as they were trampled amid the chaos.â\\x80\\x9cI was trying to stop them. They were taking away young children, and this could jeopardise their future\\'\\' says 60-year-old Venkatamma, â\\x80\\x9cTroops were all over, and I kept insisting they leave youngsters out of this. I fell and couldn\\'t manage to get up, and I was trampled on. My husband and I have worked for most of our lives on these lands, why are these people claiming that we are the encroachers?â\\x80\\x9d she says.As reported by NewsClick, by the end of July, tribals in 13 villages resisted the Forest Departmentâ\\x80\\x99s actions. Social activists and political leaders from opposition parties have consistently criticised Haritha Haram. Gudur Narayana Reddy, the treasurer of the Congress Committee (Telangana Pradesh), demanded a census of every single tree to prove the authenticity of the project in a press conference held on 20 July. He accused the government of scamming in the name of a plantation drive and also revealed that Rs 3,630 crore was spent on Haritha Haram in the past five years, by quoting an RTI query.However, government officials have rejected claims of attacks on the villagers by the Forest Department. The Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF) PV Raja Rao told The News Minute that according to the Forest Rights Act, the officials working in the forest do not touch the lands where dwellers have valid documents. He said that if an individual from the forest Department tries to interfere or does something that violates the Act, they will have to bear the consequences. He also asserted that action would be taken against a forest official on the grounds of inefficiency if they are found to be incapable of protecting the forest department\\'s land when someone tries to infringe upon it or cultivate anything on it.P Gowtham, the Project Officer at ITDA Bhadrachalam, also told The News Minute that there were no FRA claims pending in Satyanarayanapuram, as opposed to the allegations being made. He stated that officials were not approaching anyone who possessed documents and said they would set up an inquiry if they received any complaints against officials who were conducting plantation drives on lands where people had titles.The National Herald reported that activists had appealed to Arjun Munda, the Union Minister of Tribal Affairs, stating that the use of Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management (CAMPA) for Haritha Haram, which is undermining the fundamental rights of tribals, needs to be thoroughly reviewed, while expressing their concerns about the considerable social distress that this scheme is causing to tribals in Telangana.***Legislation versus realityProcuring documents by proving ownership under the guidelines of FRA 2006 has been a long, ardous process for indigenous communities across India. The government has labelled traditional forest dwellers as being encroachers without conducting proper land surveys. â\\x80\\x9cOfficers have been visiting our villages for more than ten years! We cooked for them, we worked as daily wage labourers when they needed us to. How could they call us encroachers?â\\x80\\x9d Narsamma asks in despair.According to the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) (PESA) Act 1996, panchayats in a Scheduled Area are empowered to prevent alienation of any land that takes place unlawfully. Although the Act protects the rights of tribals, the ground reality is that implementation is challenging due to constant systemic repression of tribals at the hands of the State.The incident at Satyanarayanapuram is one among many similar ones that have unfolded in the stateâ\\x80\\x99s Adivasi villages â\\x80\\x93 some of which are as recent as the last five years. In September 2017, 200 forest officers arrived at Jalagalancha village in Jayashankar Bhupalapally district and razed the homes of 36 Gutti Koya families with tractors, claimingÂ\\xa0they were encroachers. The villagers were beaten up, and the women abused. The Gutti Koyas migrated from Chhattisgarh to Telangana more than 15 years ago. They possess Aadhaar cards and voter IDs, which recognise them as residents of Telangana.This case sparked significant outrage from activists and opposition parties, following which, in 2017, a division bench of the High Court directed the government to stop the displacement of Gutti Koyas from Jalagalancha.Tribals in Telangana who were employed as daily wage workers have extensively helped in the initial phases of plantation drives under Haritha Haram. Vetti Ramesh, a resident of Jalagalacha, says, â\\x80\\x9cMost of the saplings that were planted have died. We were forced out of our lands, and our crops were destroyed to plant these saplings. We were first accused of encroaching and destroying the forest, and then made to plant these saplings, which have hardly survived.â\\x80\\x9dThe State of Forest report 2017, by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), indicates that the green cover in the state had increased by 565 sq kilometres as compared to the green cover reported in 2015. The increase in tree cover was attributed to areas outside recorded forest cover, whereas the forest cover showed depletion, the report stated. Contrary to the 2017 report, the State of Forest report 2019 shows that the forest cover increased by 0.8 percent, but the stateâ\\x80\\x99s tree cover outside recorded forest areas decreased by 155 square kilometres. The increase and decrease of the tree cover outside the recorded forest area is visible, but there is no noticeable change in the forest cover.Most reserved and protected forests across the globe have been guarded and conserved by tribal communities. Colonial methods of conservation rely on bureaucratic approaches to take away lands from indigenous people in the name of environmental safeguarding. Various studies have shown that indigenous conservation has a greater level of efficiency compared to methods where forests are imagined to be naturally free of human presence â\\x80\\x93 termed as â\\x80\\x9cfortress conservationâ\\x80\\x9d.A 2018 Rights and Resources Initiative study conducted in 28 countries, including India, reveals that instituting fortress conservation is not only harmful to the indigenous communities, but also flora and fauna. It shows that when the traditional dwellers handle conservation, the land and resources are more likely to be respected and protected on an everyday level. Despite several environmentalists raising their voice against fortress conservation while presenting adequate proof of significant results through indigenous conservation, State-implemented projects in the name of conservation continue to take place, by evicting and abusing those who call the forest their home.',\n",
       " 'New Delhi: A Delhi court on Thursday granted bail to Pinjra Tod member Natasha Narwal in a case related to the 24 February northeast Delhi riots.She, however, will not be released as she has also been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in another case related to the riots.The Delhi Police has accused Narwal of instigating the riots.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, while granting the bail, noted that the video shown by the prosecution showed Narwal participating in the \"unlawful assembly\", but it did not show anything to suggest that she indulged in or incited violence.\"Prosecution cannot say that till witnesses are examined, accused cannot be released on bail. There is no specific allegation of threat to witnesses, who are, in any case, protected and their identity concealed,\" the court said.The court further observed that Narwal did not pose any flight risk and all the witnesses in the case were either police officers or protected witnesses.The bail was granted on a personal bond of Rs 30,000 with one surety to the like amount.The Pinjra Tod member, however, would not be released from prison as there is another FIR registered against her under the UAPA in which the court took cognisance of the charge sheet on Thursday.Narwal is currently lodged in Tihar central jail.Narwal and another member of the group, Devangana Kalita, were arrested in the case in May this year by the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police, and booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including rioting, unlawful assembly and attempt to murder.They were also booked under the stringent anti-terror law - Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act - in a separate case related to the communal violence, for allegedly being part of the riots.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on 24 February after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.Pinjra Tod (Break the Cage) was founded in 2015 with an aim to make hostels and paying guest accommodations less restrictive for women students.',\n",

       " \"Jodhpur: A special court has asked the CBI to file cases against former Union minister Arun Shourie and the then-disinvestment secretary Pradip Baijal over the sale of an ITDC hotel, allegedly at a loss of Rs 244 crore to the exchequer.The CBI court also directed the filing of cases against three others associated with the sale of the Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel in Udaipur two decades ago, during the term of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre.Shourie was the minister in charge of divestment when the property, owned by the public sector India Tourism Development Corporation, was sold to Bharat Hotels Ltd, a private company.The court recalled Shourie's background as a journalist who has spoken against corruption in debates and interviews. This proved his double standards on the issue of corruption, special judge Puran Kumar Sharma said.In Wednesday's order, Sharma rejected the closure report submitted in the case by the Central Bureau of Investigation in August 2019, and asked the agency to reinvestigate it.He also ordered immediate attachment of Laxmi Vilas Palace by the Udaipur district magistrate. The hotel will remain under Rajasthan government's custody until the matter is disposed of, he ordered.Along with Shourie and Baijal, the court ordered the registration of cases against Ashish Guha, the managing director of Lazard India Ltd who was the financial adviser, valuer Kantilal Karamsey of Kantilal Karamsey & Company and Jyotsana Suri, director of Bharat Hotels Ltd.All five will be summoned before the court, the judge said.The hotel was sold to the private company for Rs 7.52 crore. During the CBI investigation, it was valued at Rs 252 crore, suggesting a loss of Rs 244 crore to the exchequer.The CBI registered a case on 13 August, 2014 that some unknown officers from Department of Disinvestment, in connivance with a private hotelier during 1999-2002 renovated and then sold Laxmi Vilas Palace at a throwaway price.The court criticised the CBI for filing a closure report despite finding in its preliminary inquiry that the property was sold wrongly. The judge said this was deplorable.He said the entire country looks up to the CBI as a prestigious agency.Appointing the district magistrate as the receiver of the property, the judge said he would produce a report on its movable and immovable assets within three months.He will also arrange that the hotel is run by a central government institution with experience in this industry. The accounts will be submitted to the court on a quarterly basis, the judge directed.The court said those engaged in the disinvestment process were IAS officers and not expected to have no idea about the worth of property like this in a city like Udaipur.The preliminary investigation validated the accusations and revealed that Pradip Baijal abused his position, entering into a conspiracy with Guha, Karamsey and Bharat Hotels Limited, the court said.Kantilal Karamsey & Company valued the land at just Rs 45 per square feet against the going rate of Rs 500-1000 per square feet then for commercial plots, it said, citing the preliminary report. It said Shourie and Baijal took the decision to appoint the valuers.\"]"
